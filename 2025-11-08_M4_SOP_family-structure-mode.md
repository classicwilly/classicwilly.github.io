# FAMILY STRUCTURE MODE (FSM-SOP)

**Active Period**: Friday 4:00 PM → Monday 6:00 PM

**Purpose**: Shared structure, low-stimulation environment, and high-vigilance parenting. Minimize "unstructured chaos" for both you and your children while maintaining your own regulation.

**Foundation**: This mode builds on top of Foundational Daily Protocols (FDP-SOP). All 5 foundational protocols remain active.
