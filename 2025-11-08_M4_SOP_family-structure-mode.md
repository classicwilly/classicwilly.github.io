# FAMILY STRUCTURE MODE (FSM-SOP)

**Active Period**: Friday 4:00 PM → Monday 6:00 PM

**Purpose**: Shared structure, low-stimulation environment, and high-vigilance parenting. Minimize "unstructured chaos" for both you and your children while maintaining your own regulation.

**Foundation**: This mode builds on top of Foundational Daily Protocols (FDP-SOP). All 5 foundational protocols remain active.

```

### 🚨 SUNDAY PREP PROTOCOL (9:00 AM - 12:00 PM) - MANDATORY

**Why This Matters**: Sunday involves 6 hours away from home (2 PM - 8 PM), a 3-hour round trip drive, family social obligations, and immediate Monday school/work transition. Without explicit prep, decision fatigue and task overwhelm cascade into Sunday night chaos and Monday morning disaster.

**Philosophy**: Reduce ALL decision-making and task execution to pre-defined checklists. No improvisation. No "we'll figure it out later." Everything gets done Sunday morning or it doesn't happen.

#### PHASE 1: Kids Prep (9:00 AM - 10:30 AM | 1.5 hours)
**Location**: Kids' rooms + common areas

**Willow's Prep** (Age 6 - Dad assists heavily):
- [ ] Make bed (pull covers, fluff pillow)
- [ ] Pick Monday school outfit (lay on chair)
- [ ] Pack school backpack with Dad's help:
  - [ ] Homework folder (if any)
  - [ ] Water bottle (filled)
  - [ ] Lunch box (empty - Dad packs Monday AM)
  - [ ] Library books (if due)
  - [ ] Jacket/sweatshirt
- [ ] Complete 3 daily chores (bedroom, dining room, living room)
- [ ] Change into car clothes (comfy: leggings + cozy shirt)
- [ ] Pack PJs in backpack (for changing at Grandma's before drive home)
- [ ] Pick one entertainment item for car (book or small toy - NO screens unless emergency)

**Sebastian's Prep** (Age 9 - Mostly independent, Dad double-checks):
- [ ] Make bed (full bed making: sheets, blankets, pillows)
- [ ] Pick Monday school outfit (lay out complete)
- [ ] Pack school backpack (self-check, Dad verifies):
  - [ ] All homework completed and packed
  - [ ] iPad/tablet charged (if school device)
  - [ ] Water bottle (filled)
  - [ ] Lunch box (empty - Dad packs Monday AM)
  - [ ] Permission slips/school papers signed
  - [ ] PE clothes (if PE day)
  - [ ] Jacket/sweatshirt
- [ ] Complete 3 daily chores (bedroom, bathroom, living room)
- [ ] Help Dad with house prep (trash out, pet check)
- [ ] Change into car clothes (sweats + hoodie)
- [ ] Pack PJs in backpack (for Grandma's)
- [ ] Pick car entertainment (book, sketchpad, handheld game - screens OK for Sebastian)

**Dad's Role During Phase 1**:
- Supervise Willow closely (she needs more help)
- Spot-check Sebastian (he's more independent)
- Answer questions without making new decisions ("stick to the list")
- Keep kids on task without creating stress

#### PHASE 2: House Prep (10:30 AM - 11:15 AM | 45 minutes)
**Location**: Whole house

- [ ] **House security**:
  - [ ] All windows closed
  - [ ] Doors locked (check front, back, garage)
  - [ ] Valuables secured
  - [ ] Lights on timers (if applicable)
- [ ] **Monday Prep** (reduces Monday AM chaos):
  - [ ] Lay out Monday work clothes (full outfit: underwear to shoes)
  - [ ] Prep Monday lunch components (washed fruit, prepped veggies, ready to assemble)
  - [ ] Coffee maker prepped (ready to brew - just hit button)
  - [ ] Work bag packed (laptop, charger, keys, wallet, phone)

#### PHASE 3: Personal & Vehicle Prep (11:15 AM - 12:00 PM | 45 minutes)
**Location**: Bathroom, bedroom, garage

**Personal Prep**:
- [ ] Shower (if needed - you'll be with family for 5+ hours)
- [ ] Change into "Grandma-appropriate" clothes (clean, casual, comfortable for driving)
- [ ] Medication check (did you take Sunday AM pills?)
- [ ] Hydration (drink full water bottle - you're about to drive)
- [ ] Mental prep: "Social mode active. High vigilance. Short duration. You can do this."

**Vehicle Prep**:
- [ ] **Gas check** (at least 1/2 tank - no stopping with kids in car)
- [ ] **Kids' car entertainment loaded**:
  - [ ] Willow's book/toy accessible
  - [ ] Sebastian's entertainment accessible
  - [ ] Backup snacks in car (goldfish, granola bars - non-messy)
  - [ ] Water bottles in cup holders

  - [ ] Bubble Shield charged and in car (Soundcore Space One - for sensory regulation if needed)
  - [ ] Sunglasses accessible

#### PHASE 4: Early Lunch & Buffer (12:00 PM - 1:00 PM | 1 hour)
- **12:00 PM - 12:30 PM**: Quick lunch at home
  - Simple, no-cook meal (sandwiches, leftovers, cereal)
  - Hydration check for everyone
  - Bathroom break for kids (mandatory - no stops on road)
- **12:30 PM - 1:00 PM**: Buffer time
  - Use for any missed prep tasks
  - Calm down period (no new activities)
  - Final mental prep: "Everything is ready. We just drive now."

  - Kids use bathroom (last chance)

  - **NO LATE DEPARTURES** (creates rushed driving, stressed arrival)

### 🏠 AT GRANDMA'S HOUSE (3:30 PM - 7:30 PM | 4 hours)

**Your Role**: High vigilance, low stimulation (for yourself)

**Kids' Expectations** (covered in their SOP, but you enforce):
- Use inside voices
- Ask before taking food/drinks
- Stay in visible areas
- Use manners (please/thank you)
- Tell you if bathroom needed or feeling sick

**Your Strategy**:
- **Bubble Shield available** (Profile 2.0 in pocket if social overwhelm hits)
- **Low conversation energy** (you don't have to be "on" - presence is enough)
- **Monitor kids without micromanaging** (they know the rules)
- **Eat, hydrate, use bathroom** (take care of your needs)
- **Around 7:00 PM**: Initiate kids' PJ change (before drive home)
  - "Sebastian, Willow - go change into PJs now. We're leaving in 30 minutes."
  - Reduces home arrival chaos (they'll be ready for bed)

### 🚗 DRIVE HOME (7:30 PM - 8:00 PM | 30 minutes)

**Kids**: Already in PJs, may fall asleep in car (ideal)

**You**: Focus on driving, minimize conversation

**Arrive Home 8:00 PM**:
- Kids already in PJs ✓
- Backpacks already in trunk for Monday ✓
- Monday clothes already laid out ✓
- Monday lunch prep already done ✓

**This is why Sunday Prep matters.**

### 🌙 RAPID BEDTIME ROUTINE (8:00 PM - 8:30 PM | 30 minutes)
