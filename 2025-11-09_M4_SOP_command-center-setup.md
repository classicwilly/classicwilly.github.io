# COMMAND CENTER SETUP SOP (CCS-SOP)

**Date Created**: 2025-11-09  
**Purpose**: Define the complete equipment, software, and spatial requirements for the neurodivergent-optimized Command Center. Every choice matters. This is top priority.

**Philosophy**: The Command Center is the physical and digital foundation for all Solo Execution Mode work. It must eliminate friction, reduce cognitive load, and maximize focus capacity. This is not optional equipment—this is the infrastructure that makes everything else possible.

---

## 1.0 SPACE REQUIREMENTS

### 1.1 Minimum Physical Footprint
- **Desk Surface**: 60" × 30" minimum (5 sq ft)
- **Clearance**: 36" behind chair for movement
- **Height**: Adjustable 28"-48" (standing desk capability)
- **Total Floor Space**: ~25 sq ft minimum

**Why This Matters**: 
- Autism/ADHD require reduced sensory overwhelm
- Fixed spatial boundaries create predictability
- Standing capability prevents hyperfocus-induced physical strain
- Room to move = executive function preservation

### 1.2 Optimal Configuration
- **Desk Surface**: 72" × 30" (6 sq ft) - allows dual monitor setup + physical notebook space
- **Dedicated Room**: 10' × 10' (100 sq ft) with door for isolation
- **Window Access**: Natural light + ability to cover for glare control
- **Climate Control**: Independent thermostat or space heater/fan

**Why Optimal Matters**:
- Door = hard boundary for Family Structure Mode transitions
- Window = circadian rhythm regulation (critical for sleep anchor protocol)
- Climate control = sensory regulation (temperature sensitivity common in ASD)

## 2.0 HARDWARE: TIER SYSTEM

### TIER 1: MUST HAVES (Non-Negotiable)

#### 2.1 Primary Computing
**Desktop PC or High-Performance Laptop**
- **Minimum Specs**:
  - CPU: Intel i5 11th gen or AMD Ryzen 5 5600 equivalent
  - RAM: 16GB DDR4
  - Storage: 512GB NVMe SSD
  - GPU: Integrated graphics acceptable
- **Rationale**:
  - VS Code + Chrome + NotebookLM + Jekyll dev server simultaneously
  - Multiple browser tabs for research (ADHD info gathering patterns)
  - Fast boot times reduce transition friction
  - SSD = instant file access (reduces waiting-induced context switching)

**Budget**: $600-$800 (refurbished Dell Optiplex or custom build)

**Where to Buy** (Per Attached Guide):
1. Costco (best return policy + price)
2. Amazon (Prime shipping + reviews)

  - Inputs: HDMI + DisplayPort
  - VESA mount compatible
- **Rationale**:
  - Reduces neck strain (ergonomics)
  - Sufficient real estate for side-by-side windows (documentation + code)
  - IPS = no color shift when standing vs sitting
  - VESA = adjustable height (critical for standing desk use)

**Budget**: $150-$250

**Alternative**: Dual 24" monitors ($300 total) for enhanced multitasking

#### 2.3 Input Devices
**Keyboard**: Mechanical or High-Quality Membrane
- **Must Have**: Full-size with numpad

- **Budget**: $50-$100
- **Recommendations**: Keychron C1, Logitech K840

**Mouse**: Wired or Wireless Ergonomic
- **Must Have**: At least 2 programmable buttons
- **Preference**: Vertical or angled (reduces wrist strain)
- **Budget**: $25-$60
- **Recommendations**: Logitech MX Master 3, Anker Vertical Mouse

**Rationale**: 
- Tactile keyboard feedback = ADHD dopamine micro-hits during typing
- Ergonomic mouse = prevents RSI during hyperfocus marathons
- Wired option = zero input lag (critical for flow state maintenance)

#### 2.4 Audio System (The Bubble Shield)

## 8.0 VALUE OPTIMIZATION (Per Attached Guide Principles)

### Pre-Purchase Questions (For Every Item)
1. **Do we actually need it?** Will this eliminate friction or just add complexity?
2. **What's the ROI?** How much focus capacity or time does this recover?
3. **Is this the right solution?** Or is there a simpler non-monetary fix?
4. **What's the failure cost?** If this item breaks, what's the productivity loss?

### Buying Strategy
1. **Check Costco first** (best return policy + pricing)
2. **Amazon Prime second** (reviews + fast shipping)
3. **Craigslist/eBay for office surplus** (business-class refurbs)
4. **Use 10% Lowes/Home Depot coupons** (for desk/furniture)
5. **Search slickdeals.net** (for planned purchases)
6. **Set CamelCamelCamel alerts** (for non-urgent items)

### Quality vs. Price Balance
- **Cheap = High Replacement Cost**: Especially for keyboard/mouse (daily use items)
- **Expensive = Low Ongoing Cost**: Chair and desk (prevents RSI, supports 7hr blocks)
- **ROI Calculation**: If it saves 15 min/day setup time = 91 hrs/year = $2,730 value (at $30/hr rate)

## 9.0 TROUBLESHOOTING

### Issue: Can't Focus Even With Perfect Setup
**Diagnosis**: Command Center is necessary but not sufficient
**Fix**: Review Foundational Daily Protocols (FDP-SOP) - likely sleep, hydration, or medication protocol failing

### Issue: Physical Discomfort During Work Blocks
**Diagnosis**: Ergonomics failure
**Fix**: 
1. Monitor at eye level (adjust stand or desk height)
2. Chair lumbar support engaged
3. Keyboard/mouse at elbow height
4. Alternate sitting/standing every 90 min

### Issue: Constant Distraction From Household Noise
**Diagnosis**: Bubble Shield insufficient OR door boundary violated
**Fix**:
1. Upgrade to Profile 1.0 (Transparency 3, Vol 20%)
2. Add white noise machine as background layer
3. Enforce Command Center door policy during Solo Execution Mode

### Issue: Google Workspace Not Syncing
**Diagnosis**: Drive for Desktop configuration issue
**Fix**:
1. Check internet connection (ethernet preferred)
2. Restart Google Drive app
3. Verify sync folder paths
4. Check storage quota (free up space if >90% full)

## 11.0 NOTES

**Last Updated**: 2025-11-09  
**Status**: ACTIVE - Deployment in progress  
**Priority**: TOP - Foundation for all Solo Execution Mode work

**Key Principle**: The Command Center is not about having the best gear. It's about eliminating every friction point between your brain and your output. Every choice exists to reduce cognitive load, maintain focus capacity, and preserve executive function.

**Anti-BS Check**: If you find yourself spending 2 hours optimizing a $10 purchase, you've violated the Value Optimization principle. Make the decision, execute, move on.

**Wonky Sprout Philosophy**: Structure and organization with a bit of chaos. The Command Center provides the structure. Your brain provides the chaos. Together, they build systems.
