# HOUSE CLEANING PROTOCOL (SOP-HC)

**Zone-based maintenance system for neurodivergent households.**

---

## THE CORE PROBLEM

Executive dysfunction + visual processing issues = you literally cannot see the mess until it's overwhelming. Then you freeze because "clean the house" is too big and abstract.

**This is not laziness. This is a failed maintenance system.**

---

## THE SOLUTION: ZONE-BASED ROTATION

**Don't clean the house. Maintain zones on a schedule.**

Breaking the house into zones with specific time limits removes decision paralysis. You're not "cleaning until it's done." You're executing a 15-minute protocol.

---

## DAILY MAINTENANCE (15 Minutes Total)

**Schedule:** Every day at 9:00 PM (or consistent time that works)  
**Rule:** Do these BEFORE they become emergencies  
**Tool:** Phone timer set for 5 minutes per zone

### Zone 1: Kitchen (5 minutes)

**Dishes Protocol:**
1. Every dirty dish goes directly into dishwasher or sink (no counter sitting)
2. If dishwasher is full → Run it NOW (don't wait for "one more dish")
3. If sink has dishes → Set timer, wash as many as possible in 5 minutes

**Counter Wipe:**
- One pass with wet rag or disinfectant wipe over all counters
- Don't organize, just wipe surfaces

**Trash Check:**
- Bag 80% full? → Take it out immediately
- Don't wait for overflow—prevention is easier than cleanup

**When timer beeps:** Stop. Even if not "done." This is maintenance, not perfection.

---

### Zone 2: Bathroom (5 minutes)

**Sink/Counter Clean:**
1. Spray with cleaner or use disinfectant wipe
2. Wipe down sink, faucet, counter
3. Wipe mirror if visible spots

**Toilet Quick-Clean:**
1. Spray bowl with toilet cleaner
2. Let it sit while you do other tasks
3. Quick scrub with toilet brush (30 seconds)
4. Flush

**Towel Check:**
- Towels hanging? Good.
- Towels on floor? Pick up → hang or hamper

**Floor Scan:**
- Kick any visible clutter to corner for later sorting
- Wipe up any obvious spills

**When timer beeps:** Stop. Bathroom doesn't need to sparkle daily.

---

### Zone 3: Living Space (5 minutes)

**Flat Surface Rule:**
Every flat surface should be clear:
1. Coffee table: Move items to where they belong or to "sorting box"
2. Couch: Remove items, fold blanket if present
3. Floor: Pick up anything that doesn't belong on floor

**Trash Sweep:**
1. Walk through with small trash bag
2. Grab obvious garbage (wrappers, bottles, papers)
3. Take bag to kitchen trash

**Laundry Pile Control:**
- Dirty clothes on floor → Toss in hamper
- Clean clothes on couch → Fold or put in basket for later

**When timer beeps:** Stop. Living space just needs to be functional, not magazine-ready.

---

## WEEKLY DEEP CLEAN (60 Minutes)

**Schedule:** Sunday 9:00-10:00 AM (or pick consistent day/time)  
**Rotation:** 4-week cycle focusing on different areas  
**Tool:** Set phone timer for each task to prevent hyperfocus or avoidance

## EMERGENCY RESET: HOUSE IS A DISASTER

**When to Deploy:** House is actively stressing you out and you can't see the floor.  
**Time Required:** 2-3 hours  
**Goal:** Restore basic functionality, not perfection.

---

### PHASE 1: TRASH BLITZ (15 minutes)

**Tools:** Large trash bag, phone timer

**Protocol:**
1. Start timer for 15 minutes
2. Walk through every room with trash bag
3. Throw away ONLY obvious trash:
   - Food wrappers
   - Empty bottles/cans
   - Paper garbage
   - Anything clearly trash
4. **DO NOT ORGANIZE. JUST TRASH.**
5. When timer beeps, tie bag and take to outdoor bin immediately

**Why this works:** Trash removal has instant visual impact and creates space for next steps.

---

### PHASE 2: DISHES PURGE (20 minutes)

**Tools:** Dish soap, dishwasher, phone timer

**Protocol:**
1. Walk through house, collect every dish from every room
2. Bring all dishes to kitchen sink
3. Set timer for 20 minutes
4. Load dishwasher completely (don't worry about "optimal loading")
5. Start dishwasher
6. Hand-wash any remaining dishes OR fill sink with soapy water to soak
7. When timer beeps, stop (even if dishes remain—soaking is fine)

**Why this works:** Dishes are depression/executive dysfunction red flag. Clearing them breaks the shame spiral.

---

### PHASE 3: LAUNDRY BOMB (15 minutes active)

**Tools:** Laundry basket, detergent, phone timer

**Protocol:**
1. Walk through house, collect all dirty clothes
2. Bring to laundry area
3. Don't sort—just load first batch into washer (darks or lights, pick one)
4. Add detergent, start cycle
5. Set timer on phone for when cycle ends (usually 30-45 min)
6. **Move on to next phase while wash runs**

**When wash finishes:**
- Move to dryer, start dryer
- Load second batch in washer
- Set timer for dryer

**Why this works:** Starting laundry early means it runs in background while you tackle other zones.

---

### PHASE 4: FLOOR CLEAR (30 minutes)

**Tools:** 3 boxes/bags (Trash, Clothes, Stuff), phone timer

**Protocol:**
1. Set timer for 30 minutes
2. Start in living room, work through each room
3. Pick up everything on floor
4. Sort into 3 categories:
   - **TRASH:** Throw away immediately
   - **CLOTHES:** Toss in hamper or into washer
   - **STUFF:** Put in box for later sorting
5. **DO NOT ORGANIZE THE STUFF. JUST CLEAR FLOORS.**
6. Goal: Create walking paths and visible floor space

**Why this works:** Floor clear = instant sense of control. You can walk without stepping on things.

---

### PHASE 5: SURFACE RESET (30 minutes)

**Tools:** Disinfectant wipes or spray cleaner + rag, phone timer

**Protocol:**
1. Set timer for 30 minutes
2. Hit high-impact surfaces only:
   - **Kitchen counters:** Wipe clean
   - **Bathroom sink/counter:** Wipe clean
   - **Bathroom toilet:** Quick spray + wipe
   - **Coffee table/couch:** Clear off, wipe down
   - **Bed:** Make it or at least straighten blankets
3. When timer beeps, stop

**Why this works:** Clean surfaces = visual calm. Brain interprets this as "under control."

---

### PHASE 6: MAINTENANCE LOCK-IN (5 minutes)

**Critical step to prevent re-collapse:**

1. **Set recurring alarm on phone:**
   - Time: 9:00 PM daily
   - Label: "15-min Daily Clean"
   - Enable every day

2. **Calendar block next Weekly Deep Clean:**
   - Sunday 9:00-10:00 AM (or your chosen day/time)
   - Set reminder 30 min before

3. **Commit to 7-day streak:**
   - For next 7 days, do 15-minute daily maintenance when alarm goes off
   - This rebuilds the habit before chaos returns

**Why this works:** Emergency reset is temporary. Locking in daily maintenance prevents next collapse.

---

## TROUBLESHOOTING

### "I can't even start the 15-minute daily clean"

**Deploy Executive Dysfunction Emergency Protocol:**
- See: `/2025-11-08_M4_IPI_executive-dysfunction-emergency`
- Body reset → Environment reset → Task reset
- Then attempt 5-minute kitchen zone only

### "I missed 3 days of daily maintenance"

**Don't try to catch up:**
- Just do today's 15-minute clean
- The "missed" days are gone—focus on today
- Consistency > perfection

### "The weekly deep clean feels overwhelming"

**Break it into 2 sessions:**
- 30 minutes Saturday morning
- 30 minutes Sunday morning
- Or do 15-minute chunks across the week

### "I live with other people who don't follow this"

**Negotiate shared zones:**
- Assign zones (you: kitchen, them: bathroom)
- OR: You maintain your bedroom/personal space using this system
- Can't control others, can control your protocols

### "House is clean but I feel guilty for letting it get bad"

**This is not a moral issue:**
- Systems fail. That's why protocols exist.
- Clean house now = system is working
- Shame doesn't fix anything. Protocols do.

---

## INTEGRATION WITH OTHER PROTOCOLS

### Morning Routine
- **6:30-6:45 AM:** Quick kitchen wipe while making coffee/breakfast

### Evening Routine
- **9:00-9:15 PM:** Daily 15-minute maintenance (kitchen, bathroom, living space)

### Weekly Review
- **Friday 3:00 PM (Solo Mode) or Sunday 8:30 PM (Family Mode):**
  - Review: Did I do daily maintenance 5+ days this week?
  - Schedule: Confirm next Weekly Deep Clean on calendar

---

## TOOLS REQUIRED

**Minimum Supplies:**
- All-purpose cleaner or disinfectant wipes
- Toilet bowl cleaner + toilet brush
- Dish soap
- Laundry detergent
- Trash bags (13 gal kitchen, 8 gal bathroom/bedroom)
- Vacuum or broom + dustpan
- Mop or Swiffer with wet pads
- Paper towels or reusable rags (microfiber cloths work great)

**Optional but Helpful:**
- Rubber gloves (if textures bother you)
- Long-handled duster (for fans, high shelves)
- Scrub brush (for tough stains)
- Glass cleaner (for mirrors, windows)

---

## FINAL REMINDER

**Your house is not your worth.**

- Messy house = broken maintenance system
- Clean house = functional maintenance system
- This protocol exists to fix the system, not shame you for the mess

**Deploy. Execute. Repeat.**
