title: Executive Dysfunction Emergency Protocol

# EXECUTIVE DYSFUNCTION EMERGENCY PROTOCOL (IPI-ED)

**Trigger**: Everything feels impossible. You cannot start any task. You are frozen. The simplest action feels like climbing a mountain.

**Purpose**: This is the emergency reboot protocol for completely frozen executive function. It bypasses the rational brain and forces a physical reset to restore basic operational capacity.

**Classification**: Immediate Problem Instruction (IPI) - Execute immediately when triggered. Do not think. Just execute.

---

## RECOGNITION SIGNALS

You are in Executive Dysfunction Emergency if **3 or more** of these are true:

- [ ] You've been staring at your task list for 10+ minutes without starting anything
- [ ] Simple tasks feel overwhelming (responding to a text, making coffee, opening a file)
- [ ] You're scrolling social media/news but not actually reading or enjoying it
- [ ] You feel physically heavy or stuck in your chair
- [ ] Time is passing but you're not doing anything productive or restful
- [ ] You're thinking "I should just..." but your body won't move
- [ ] You feel guilt/shame about not working but still can't start
- [ ] Your mind is foggy, thoughts are slow, nothing feels urgent

**If 3+ signals present: STOP EVERYTHING. Execute this protocol immediately.**

## PHASE 1: BODY RESET (5 Minutes)

**Purpose**: Address physical root causes that mimic or worsen executive dysfunction. The brain cannot function if the body is broken.

### Step 1: Water Fix (60 seconds)
- **Action**: Drink 16 oz (1 full glass) of water immediately
- **Why**: Dehydration mimics ADHD symptoms. Fix the easiest problem first.
- **Tool**: Water bottle at Command Center
- **Non-Negotiable**: Do this before anything else

### Step 2: Food Check (60 seconds)
- **Question**: "When did I last eat? What did I eat?"
- **If last meal was 3+ hours ago OR was junk/sugar-heavy:**
  - Eat protein immediately (handful of nuts, cheese stick, protein bar, hard-boiled egg)
  - Set timer for 15 minutes to check if fog lifts
- **Why**: Blood sugar crashes destroy executive function
- **Tool**: Emergency protein stash (desk drawer, kitchen cabinet)

### Step 3: Medication Check (30 seconds)
- **Question**: "Did I take my pills today?"
- **Action**: Check pill organizer. If today's slot is full, take pills immediately.
- **Why**: Missing ADHD medication or supplements will cause total shutdown
- **Tool**: 7-day pill organizer at Command Center

### Step 4: Movement Protocol (3 minutes)
- **Action**: Stand up and execute one of these:
  1. **Walk outside** (around the block, to the mailbox, 3 minutes minimum)
  2. **Stairs** (up and down 2 flights, or 3 repetitions if you have stairs)
  3. **Jumping jacks** (30 reps, at any speed)
  4. **Dance/shake** (put on one song, move your body)
- **Why**: Movement forces blood flow to the brain and disrupts the freeze state
- **Non-Negotiable**: Pick the easiest option. Movement quality does not matter. Just move.

## PHASE 2: ENVIRONMENT RESET (3 Minutes)

**Purpose**: Reduce sensory chaos and create a controlled "bubble" that supports focus.

### Step 5: Bubble Shield Deployment (60 seconds)
- **Action**: Put on headphones immediately
  - **Solo Mode**: Profile 1.0 (Transparency 3, Volume 20%)
  - **Family Mode**: Profile 2.0 (Transparency 5, Volume 10%)
- **Why**: External noise is cognitive load. Remove it.
- **Tool**: Soundcore Space One headphones

### Step 6: Visual Chaos Reduction (90 seconds)
- **Action**: Clear your immediate field of vision
  1. Close all browser tabs except the ONE you need for next task
  2. Close all apps except the ONE you need for next task
  3. Move clutter/papers out of your direct sight line (shove in drawer if needed)
  4. Turn off overhead lights if they're fluorescent/harsh
- **Why**: Visual clutter = cognitive load. Reduce input = reduce overwhelm.

### Step 7: Temperature Check (30 seconds)
- **Question**: "Am I too hot or too cold?"
- **Action**: 
  - Too hot: Remove a layer, turn on fan, drink cold water
  - Too cold: Add a layer, grab blanket, drink warm beverage
- **Why**: Temperature discomfort is a constant background drain on focus
- **Tool**: Hoodie, blanket, fan (keep accessible at Command Center)

## PHASE 3: TASK RESET (3 Minutes)

**Purpose**: Break the task paralysis by selecting the smallest possible action that creates forward momentum.

### Step 8: Task List Triage (60 seconds)
- **Action**: Look at your task list and answer these questions:
  1. "Which task is making me feel the most guilt/dread?"
  2. "Which task would take less than 5 minutes?"
  3. "Which task would I actually enjoy doing right now?"
- **Choose ONE task** based on:
  - If you have deadline pressure: Pick the guilt/dread task
  - If you have no pressure: Pick the enjoyable task
  - If you're still frozen: Pick the 5-minute task

### Step 9: Micro-Action Extraction (60 seconds)
- **Action**: Take your chosen task and break it into the **smallest possible first action**
- **Examples**:
  - "Write report" → "Open Google Docs"
  - "Respond to email" → "Click reply button"
  - "Call dentist" → "Find phone number"
  - "Clean kitchen" → "Put one dish in dishwasher"
- **Why**: Starting is the hardest part. Make starting so small it feels stupid.

### Step 10: Timer + Execute (60 seconds setup, 5-10 minute execution)
- **Action**:
  1. Set phone timer for 10 minutes
  2. Say out loud: "I am doing [MICRO-ACTION] for 10 minutes, then I can stop."
  3. Start timer
  4. Execute the micro-action
- **When timer ends**: 
  - If you want to keep going: Keep going
  - If you want to stop: Stop and celebrate that you broke the freeze
- **Why**: Commitment to 10 minutes removes the pressure of "finishing" and tricks the brain into starting

---

## PHASE 4: LOOP PREVENTION (Ongoing)

**Purpose**: Prevent re-freezing after initial recovery. Build momentum sustainably.

### After First 10-Minute Block
- **If you kept working**: Good. Keep going until you naturally hit a stopping point.
- **If you stopped after 10 minutes**: Good. Take a 5-minute break, then repeat Step 10 with a new micro-action.

### If You Freeze Again Within 2 Hours
- **Action**: Return to Phase 1, Step 1 (Water Fix) and re-execute the entire protocol
- **Why**: Something is still broken (hunger, dehydration, sensory overload). Fix the body first.

### Daily Pattern Recognition
- **Action**: At your Daily Dump (10:25 PM), note when today's freeze happened
- **Track**:
  - Time of day
  - What you ate/drank in previous 3 hours
  - Sleep quality last night
  - Stress level (1-10)
- **Why**: Patterns emerge. You can predict and prevent future freezes.

## INTEGRATION WITH EXISTING PROTOCOLS

### When to Use This IPI
- **During Solo Execution Mode**: Use when you hit a freeze during core work blocks
- **During Family Structure Mode**: Use during Quiet Time (1-3 PM) or after family chaos subsides
- **Emergency Override**: This IPI overrides all other protocols when activated

### Return to Normal Operations
- **After successful reboot**: Return to your current mode's hourly schedule
- **If reboot fails after 2 attempts**: This is a red-flag day. Consider:
  1. Checking Priority Hierarchy (Sleep → Food → Water → Medicine - are these actually handled?)
  2. Declaring a "Maintenance Day" and reducing expectations to foundational protocols only
  3. Reviewing last week's sleep data (multiple bad nights = executive function breakdown)

---

## SUCCESS METRICS

**You have successfully executed this protocol when:**
- You completed at least one 10-minute task block
- You identified and addressed a physical root cause (water, food, medication)
- You broke the scroll/stare paralysis cycle
- You feel slightly less overwhelmed (even if still not "good")

**This protocol is NOT designed to:**
- Make you feel amazing
- Fix chronic executive dysfunction (that's what the daily SOPs do)
- Solve systemic problems (burnout, sleep debt, life chaos)

**This is a band-aid for an acute crisis. Use it, then investigate the root cause later.**

---

## TOOLS REQUIRED

- Water bottle (filled)
- Pill organizer (7-day)
- Emergency protein stash (nuts, protein bars, cheese)
- Soundcore Space One headphones
- Phone timer
- Task list (Google Tasks or similar)

---

## FINAL NOTE

**If this protocol is needed more than 2-3 times per week**: Your foundational protocols are failing. Review your sleep anchor, food timing, and medication consistency. Executive dysfunction is often a symptom, not the root problem.

**Remember**: The freeze is not a moral failure. It's a systems failure. This protocol is the emergency fix. Now execute it.
