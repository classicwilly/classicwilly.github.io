## PRIORITY HIERARCHY REMINDER

If you're struggling with any protocol, check these first:

1. **Sleep** - Did I get 7-8 hours last night?
2. **Food** - Have I eaten protein in the last 3 hours?
3. **Water** - Have I had 16+ oz today?
4. **Medicine** - Did I take my pills this morning?

Cannot fix executive function if these 4 are failing.
