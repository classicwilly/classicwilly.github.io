# The Wonky Sprout - Brand Guide v1

**By Will Johnson on 11/07/2025**

## Brand Name

The Wonky Sprout

## Core Identity

This is the personal brand of Will Johnson. It represents a personal journey of discovery and a unique way of thinking. It is an authentic identity, not a corporate "operation".

## The "Why" (Our Story)

I was diagnosed with Autism and ADHD at 40. For my entire life, I've experienced the world through a lens of "chaos". A brain I described as "a little man in my head bombarded with every possible thought." During meditation, I had a profound experience where I watched my brain file itself, in real-time, like a card catalog. This brand is the synthesis of that moment.

## The Core Message (The "Wonky" Principle)

"Structure and organization with a bit of chaos."

This brand is the perfect blend of two opposing, but complementary, forces:

- **The Sprout (Organic Chaos)**: Represents natural, non-linear, creative thinking. The "wonky" part.
- **The Mechanical (Structured Order)**: Represents the "card catalog"—the gears, circuits, and systems that I build to "fix stuff."

## The Vibe (How It Feels)

"Manly, still soft."

"I fix stuff."

Authentic, direct, and systems-oriented.

## Brand Slogan

"It's okay to be a little wonky."

## Key Visuals

- **The Emblem**: A sprout (organic) growing from a base of circuit-board-like hexagons (structure).
- **The Logotype**: The name "The Wonky Sprout," where the "O"s are replaced with intricate, colorful gears (the "fix").
- **The Palette**: A mix of natural greens (sprout) with industrial and electric teals/blues (circuitry).
