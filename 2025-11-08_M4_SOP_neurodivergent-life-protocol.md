# NEURODIVERGENT LIFE SOP (NDL-SOP)

**Purpose**: The definitive operating system for maintaining executive function, sensory regulation, and high-output productivity across dual-mode life structure.

**Integration**: This SOP works in conjunction with `2025-11-08_M4_SOP_classicwilly-protocol.md` for execution and references tools defined in `2025-11-08_M4_CONFIG_readme-master-sop.md`.

## FOUNDATIONAL PROTOCOLS (DAILY FIXES)

These protocols are **non-negotiable** and run every day, regardless of mode. They represent your **minimum viable structure** to maintain stable executive function.

### 1. Water Protocol
- **Purpose**: Physical Fix - Prevents dehydration chaos (crucial for focus)
- **Action**: Drink 1 full glass of water immediately upon waking
- **Tool**: Keep filled bottle at Command Center (desk)
- **Time**: AM (Upon Waking)

### 2. Pill Protocol
- **Purpose**: Health Fix - Ensures stable executive function from medication/supplements
- **Action**: Use daily pill organizer (visual cue), take all pills immediately after water
- **Tool**: 7-day pill organizer
- **Time**: AM (After Water)

### 3. Capture Protocol
- **Purpose**: Thought Fix - Stops "fleeting thoughts" chaos and prevents loss of valuable data
- **Action**: If a thought hits, capture immediately. DO NOT process yet—just capture.
- **Tool**: Soundcore AI Recorder OR Google Keep
- **Time**: All Day (Instant)

### 4. Sleep Anchor
- **Purpose**: Regulator Fix - Ensures neuroplasticity and stable function
- **Action**: Bedtime (e.g., 10:30 PM) is non-negotiable anchor. Begin sleep routine (low light, low stimulation) 30 min before.
- **Tool**: Phone alarm + bedroom environment prep
- **Time**: PM (Anchor)

### 5. Daily Dump
- **Purpose**: Mental Fix - Clears cognitive load and prevents "chaos" from running while you sleep
- **Action**: Spend 5 minutes writing down next day's 3 most critical tasks
- **Tool**: Google Tasks
- **Time**: PM (Before Sleep)

## MODE 1: SOLO EXECUTION (Mon 6 PM - Fri 4 PM)

**Mission**: High-focus output, systems building, and deep work. This is your time to be the **classicwilly Diagnostician**.

### Planning & Filing (1 Hour - Morning)
- **Protocol**: The Card Catalog Time
- **Action**: Process all Google Keep notes and recorder captures. File critical info into NotebookLM or VS Code.
- **Note**: Start the day by clearing the internal system. Use this time to load the 3 critical tasks from Google Tasks.

### Core Work (3-4 Hours - Mid-Morning)
- **Protocol**: Deep Work Block
- **Action**: Engage Bubble Shield Profile 1.0 (Transparency 3). Focus ONLY on the day's 3 critical tasks.
- **Tool**: Soundcore Space One headphones, Pomodoro Technique (25 min on/5 min rest)
- **Note**: Reference `2025-11-08_M4_SOP_classicwilly-protocol.md` for 11/10 execution standards.

### Meal Prep (1 Hour - Monday AM)
- **Protocol**: Low-Friction Fuel
- **Action**: Prep 3-4 simple, high-protein meals in pre-portioned containers
- **Note**: Decision fatigue is eliminated when food choices are fixed.

### Tidy Block (15 Mins - Lunch/Evening)
- **Protocol**: Environment Fix
- **Action**: Quickly reset Command Center and kitchen. Everything returns to its designated place.
- **Note**: The system must be clean to run 11/10.

### Movement (30 Mins - Late Afternoon)
- **Protocol**: Regulation Fix
- **Action**: Forced physical activity to regulate dopamine/impulses
- **Options**: Weightlifting, walking, or dedicated gardening
- **Note**: Must be physical—non-negotiable.

---

## MODE 2: FAMILY STRUCTURE (Fri 4 PM - Mon 6 PM)

**Mission**: Shared structure, low-stimulation environment, and high-vigilance. Minimize "unstructured chaos" for both you and your children.

### Transition & Planning
- **Protocol**: Family Card Catalog
- **Action**: Review visual schedule (whiteboard) of weekend activities (e.g., Saturday: Park, Sunday: Woodworking)
- **Tool**: Large whiteboard in common area
- **Timing**: Post schedule immediately upon arrival (Friday 4 PM)
- **Note**: Transparency removes anxiety for neurodivergent needs.

### Vigilance Mode
- **Protocol**: Bubble Shield Profile 2.0
- **Action**: Wear headphones during high-traffic times (Transparency 5 / Vol 10%)
- **Tool**: Soundcore Space One headphones
- **Note**: Maintains filtering AND situational awareness for safety.

### Meal Management
- **Protocol**: Shared Predictability
- **Action**: Dinners are fixed and non-negotiable
- **Example Schedule**:
  - Friday: Pizza
  - Saturday: Tacos
  - Sunday: Roast
- **Note**: Fixed routines provide stability for neurodivergent needs.

### Sensory Regulation
- **Protocol**: Quiet Time Protocol
- **Action**: Designate 1-2 hours of low-stimulation activity (reading, drawing, LEGOs). NO screens/high stimulation.
- **Timing**: Mid-afternoon or post-dinner
- **Note**: This block is crucial for regulating the children's "chaos."

### Play
- **Protocol**: Structured Interest Block
- **Action**: Engage in joint activity related to shared intense interest
- **Examples**: Woodworking, 3D printing, electronics projects
- **Note**: Shared hyper-focus is highly regulating and builds connection.
