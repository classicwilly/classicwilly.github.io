## CHECKLIST PHILOSOPHY

**Why checklists matter for neurodivergent brains:**

- **Reduce working memory load** - Don't hold steps in your head
- **Prevent skipped steps** - Visual confirmation of completion
- **Track compliance patterns** - See which protocols you consistently skip
- **Remove decision fatigue** - Just follow the list, don't think
- **Build momentum** - Checking boxes feels good (dopamine hit)

**Checklists are not micromanagement. They're cognitive prosthetics.**
