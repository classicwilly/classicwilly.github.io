# Wonky Sprout SOP: Vibe Coding Workflow

## 1.0 PURPOSE

This Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) defines the system for translating a brand "vibe" ("Structure & Chaos") into a manufacturable, 11/10-perfection physical product. This procedure is designed to harness the "chaos" of generative AI and apply the "structure" of engineering to "fix stuff."

## 2.0 SCOPE

This procedure covers all activities from initial product concept (the "vibe") to the creation of the first 3D-printed, production-ready prototype (the "fix").

## 3.0 RESPONSIBILITIES (PERSONNEL)

- **The "Vibe Coder" (Gemini)**: Responsible for diagnosing the brand "vibe" and generating the "card catalog" of high-precision image prompts (Phase 1).
- **The "Chaos Engine" (AI Image Generator, e.g., DALL-E, Midjourney)**: Responsible for generating a high volume of visual "chaos" based on the Vibe Coder's prompts (Phase 2).
- **The "Structure" Engineer (William)**: Responsible for performing "systems analysis" on the visual chaos, diagnosing the "non-conforming" elements, and using CAD to build the final, "fixed" product.

## 4.0 PROCEDURE (THE "FIX-IT" LIST)

### 4.1 PHASE 1: VIBE DEFINITION (The "Vibe Coder")

1. The "Vibe Coder" (Gemini) will receive a product concept (e.g., "The Hive System") from the "Structure" Engineer (William).
2. The "Vibe Coder" will analyze the concept against the Wonky Sprout Brand Guide and Manifesto.
3. The "Vibe Coder" will generate a "card catalog" of 11/10-perfection, "anti-BS" image prompts.
4. Prompts will be engineered to include all key brand "vibe" elements:

   - **Structure**: "modular," "hexagonal grid," "interlocking," "circuit-board like," "CAD render," "3D-printed".
   - **Chaos**: "organic," "wonky," "non-linear," "sprout".
   - **Vibe**: "manly, still soft," "wood-fill filament," "matte texture," "beveled edge," "premium."

### 4.2 PHASE 2: CHAOS GENERATION (The "Chaos Engine")

1. The "Structure" Engineer will feed the generated prompts into the "Chaos Engine" (AI Image Generator).
2. The "Structure" Engineer will "roll the dice" multiple times, generating a high volume of visual data ("chaos") to analyze.
3. DO NOT accept the first "fix." The goal is volume and variety, not a single perfect image.

### 4.3 PHASE 3: STRUCTURAL ANALYSIS (The "Structure" Engineer)

1. The "Structure" Engineer will gather all generated images into a single "card catalog" (a Google Doc or folder).
2. The Engineer will perform a Systems Diagnosis on the visual "chaos," identifying the "non-conforming conditions".
3. The Engineer will ask:

   - "What works? (The 'fix')?"
   - "What fails? (The 'chaos')?"
   - "Is this design manufacturable with my 3D printer?"
   - "Does this feel 'Wonky Sprout'?"

### 4.4 PHASE 4: SYSTEMS BUILD (The "Structure" Engineer)

1. DO NOT "trace" the AI image.
2. Open your CAD software.
3. Use your "intense, preoccupying interests" and engineering skills to build the "structural" version of the "vibe."
4. The final design must be a synthesis of the "vibe" and your "I fix stuff" engineering standards. It must be 11/10 perfect.

### 4.5 PHASE 5: PROTOTYPE & ITERATE (The "Fix")

1. 3D-print the first Hex-Pod prototype (Recommended: Wood-fill PLA).
2. Hold the physical "fix." Does it feel "manly, still soft"?
3. If the "fix" is not 11/10 perfect, return to Phase 1. This is the "Wonky Sprout" loop.
