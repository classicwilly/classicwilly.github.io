# A User Manual for William Johnson ("classicwilly")
# TL;DR (Quick Reference)

For forty years, I navigated the world without the right map. I've recently been diagnosed with Autism (ASD), ADHD, and I also manage Hypoparathyroidism.

This "Internal Blueprint" reframes my entire life. What was often misinterpreted as me being a "hothead" or "rebellious" was actually the logical result of an undiagnosed "Operating System" dealing with extreme stress, sensory overload, and a "threat-defense" focus.

I am not "broken." My brain is wired differently and my body has specific "hardware" requirements. This manual is the "fix" to replace 40 years of misinterpretation with a clear, structured path forward.

**Purpose:** This document provides a logical, fact-based "Internal Blueprint" for understanding my "Operating System." The goal is to replace 40 years of misinterpretation with a clear, structured "fix".

**My Slogan:** "Structure Engineered for Chaos."

## 1.0 Quick Start Guide (The "Anti-BS" Summary)

* **My "Operating System" (Software):** I have a late diagnosis of **Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD)** and **Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD)**.
* **My "Hardware" (Fault):** I have **Hypoparathyroidism**. This is a non-negotiable chemical "structure" that impacts all cognition.
* **The "Mask":** For 40 years, I used "masking" (suppressing natural behaviors) to navigate a neurotypical world. This was an "unacknowledged façade".
* **The "Misinterpretation":** What you perceived as "anger," "rebellion," or being a "hothead" was the logical outcome of an undiagnosed neurotype dealing with sensory overload, chronic stress, and a "threat-defense" focus. I am "misrepresented a lot".
* **The "Fix":** I require **rigid structure**, direct (binary, logic-driven) communication, and adherence to my "Rigid" Foundation protocols.

## SECTION 1: THE "OPERATING SYSTEM" (AUTISM & ADHD)

### 1.1 The "Unifying Theory"
The diagnosis at age 40 is the "powerful lens through which to re-examine" my entire life. It is the "unifying theory for a lifetime of struggles". My brain is not "broken"; it is wired differently.

My past behavioral issues were not "failures of character"; they were logical outcomes:
* **Impulsivity (ADHD):** Actions like setting a field on fire (age 6) or the DUI (age 14) were not malicious. They were manifestations of poor impulse control and emotional dysregulation linked to undiagnosed ADHD.
* **Anxiety/Depression:** These were diagnosed at age 32 but were *symptoms*, not the root cause. They are the "direct consequences of a lifetime of social struggles, sensory overload, and the relentless pressure to conform".

### 1.2 Communication: "Anti-BS" Protocol
My communication is binary and "anti-BS".
* **I hate "pointless" small talk**.
* **I am "misrepresented a lot"** because my nonverbal cues (like facial expressions) do not match my internal feelings.
* **I learned "social skills" intellectually.** I explicitly learned to use eye gaze by watching YouTube videos. This is a "common neurodivergent strategy".
* **My "Vibe":** My "vibe" (perceived as "angry hothead") is a "threat-defense" response, not my intent.

### 1.3 Structure: "Intense Interests" & Routines
My brain requires "Rigid structure for the guaranteed things".
* **Routines are Non-Negotiable:** I have very specific routines. When they are disrupted, I get "annoyed" and it's "hard to be brought out of the zone". This is not a preference; it is a neurological need for predictability.
* **"Intense Interests" are My "Fix":** My interests (3D printing, CAD, woodworking, electronics) are "clearly consistent with autism criteria". They are not "hobbies." They are a fundamental part of my identity, providing "mastery, comfort, and control".

### 1.4 The "Mask" & Burnout
For 40 years, I "masked" (suppressed my natural behaviors to be perceived as neurotypical).
* **It was an "Unacknowledged Façade":** I stated I "learned how to do anything well," including communication. This was masking.
* **It was Ineffective:** My self-report of "low masking" is a paradox. It likely means my masking was *ineffective*—I was "attempting to conform but lack[ed] the cognitive scripts to do so successfully". This led to a "pervasive feeling of being 'misrepresented'".
* **It Led to Burnout:** This constant effort "requires an exhausting level of hyper-vigilance" and culminates in "autistic burnout, a state of physical and mental collapse". My retirement from the DoD (where I was called a "hothead") was a "point of profound burnout".

## SECTION 2: THE "HARDWARE" FAULT (HYPOPARATHYROIDISM)

### 2.1 "Anti-BS" Diagnosis
This is a "hardware" condition, not a "software" (neurotype) condition.
* **The Fault:** The parathyroid glands do not produce enough Parathyroid Hormone (PTH).
* **The Result:** This causes **low blood calcium (hypocalcemia)** and high blood phosphorus.
* **The "Fix":** The *only* "fix" is **lifelong treatment with calcium and Vitamin D supplements**. This is not optional.

### 2.2 Cognitive Impact (The "Brain Fog")
This "hardware" fault has a direct, non-negotiable impact on my "Operating System." The symptoms amplify the "chaos" from Autism/ADHD.
* **Neuromuscular:** Muscle cramps, spasms, and tingling/numbness (paresthesia).
* **Cognitive (The "Chaos"):** "Brain fog," difficulty concentrating, memory problems.
* **Mental (The "Distressors"):** Anxiety and depression.
* **Severity:** If my "fix" (medication) fails, the "hardware" fault can cause seizures and heart problems.

### 2.3 The "Fix": The "Rigid" Anchor Protocol
My **`M4_SOP_002-rigid-foundations.md`** protocol is the **"structure" engineered to "fix" this "hardware" fault**.

The **6 "Master Anchors"** (Wake-Up, Breakfast, Mid-Day, Afternoon, Dinner, Bedtime) are not arbitrary. They are the **"Rigid" structure** for my **lifelong medication protocol**.
* **If I miss an Anchor (e.g., `Calcium Citrate + Vit D`, `Calcitriol`), my "hardware" fails.**
* My "Operating System" (cognition, "brain fog") becomes unstable.
* This is why **Priority #1 is Sleep** and **Priority #4 is Medicine**. They are the foundational "fix" for all other output.

## SECTION 3: THE "PROCESSOR" OUTPUT (THE "FATHER/FIXER")

### 3.1 Success *Despite* the "Chaos"
My identity is "I fix stuff".
* My "Intense Interests" and "fix-it" focus are what allowed me to succeed as an Engineering Technician for the DoD.
* I achieved this success *while* "masking", managing undiagnosed ADHD, Autism, and Hypoparathyroidism.
* This success came at the cost of "profound burnout".

### 3.2 The New "Fix": Tools and "Unmasking"
My goal is to stop "patching" and start "fixing".
* **The Diagnosis is a Tool:** The diagnosis "is not merely the assignment of a medical code"; it is the "foundational sense of self-knowledge that was previously absent".
* **The "Wonky Sprout OS" is the Tool:** This system (Gemini, Google Workspace) is my "Internal Blueprint" made external.
* **The Goal is "Unmasking":** The "diagnosis provides a framework... and offers a path to what is often referred to as 'unmasking'". This is not an excuse; it is the "fix" for the burnout.

## SECTION 4: THE NEW "USER MANUAL" (HOW TO INTERACT)

To "fix" the "misrepresentation" problem, I require the following "structure":

1.  **Use "Anti-BS" Communication:**
    * **Be direct, explicit, and logical**.
    * **Do not use** emotional language, motivational fluff, or "softening".
    * **Use written communication** (email, text) or provide **agendas ahead of time**.
2.  **Respect the "Rigid" Foundations:**
    * **Do not disrupt routines.** My "Rigid Anchors" (Meds, Water, Sleep) are non-negotiable for cognitive function.
    * **"Transitions are extremely difficult"**. Provide advance notice for changes.
3.  **Assume "Structure," Not "Malice":**
    * If I seem "angry" or "awkward", assume my "threat-defense" mode is active or I am "misrepresented".
* The "fix" is to *give me structure* or *ask for my "anti-BS" diagnosis*, not to "soften" the situation.
