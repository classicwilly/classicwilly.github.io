# LIFE MAINTENANCE PROTOCOL (SOP-LM)

**The unglamorous survival tasks that collapse when executive function fails.**

This SOP covers: House cleaning, groceries, personal hygiene. The stuff nobody teaches you when your brain works differently.

---

## PHILOSOPHY

**These tasks are not moral issues. They are mechanical systems.**

- Dirty house ≠ lazy. It means your maintenance system failed.
- Empty fridge ≠ irresponsible. It means your grocery protocol broke.
- Skipped shower ≠ gross. It means your hygiene routine hit friction.

**This protocol removes decision fatigue and provides step-by-step reset procedures.**

<h2 id="house-cleaning">SECTION 1: HOUSE CLEANING</h2>

### The Core Problem

Executive dysfunction + visual processing issues = you literally cannot see the mess until it's overwhelming. Then you freeze because "clean the house" is too big and abstract.

### The Solution: Zone-Based Maintenance

**Don't clean the house. Maintain zones on a rotation.**

---

### DAILY MAINTENANCE (15 Minutes Total)

**Rule:** Do these BEFORE they become emergencies.

#### Zone 1: Kitchen (5 minutes)
1. **Dishes Protocol:**
   - Dirty dish touches counter → immediately into dishwasher or sink
   - If dishwasher is full → run it NOW (don't wait for "later")
   - If sink has dishes → set 5-minute timer, wash what you can
2. **Counter Wipe:** One pass with wet rag over counters
3. **Trash Check:** If bag is 80% full → take it out (don't wait for overflow)

#### Zone 2: Bathroom (5 minutes)
1. **Sink/Counter:** Wipe down with disinfectant wipe
2. **Toilet:** Spray bowl with cleaner, let sit while you do other zones
3. **Towels:** Hanging? Good. On floor? Pick up, hang or hamper.

#### Zone 3: Living Space (5 minutes)
1. **Flat Surface Rule:** Every flat surface (coffee table, couch, floor) should be clear
2. **Trash Sweep:** Walk through with trash bag, grab obvious garbage
3. **Laundry Pile:** Dirty clothes on floor → hamper

**Total: 15 minutes. Set a timer. Stop when it beeps.**

<h2 id="groceries">SECTION 2: GROCERIES</h2>

Grocery shopping requires: planning meals, making lists, driving to store, navigating crowded aisles, decision-making, checkout interaction, unloading/putting away. That's 7+ executive function tasks. No wonder we eat cereal for dinner.

### The Solution: Template-Based Shopping

---

### SHOPPING EXECUTION PROTOCOL

**Goal:** Get in, get out, minimize overwhelm.

#### Pre-Shop Setup (5 minutes)
1. Take photo of template with checked boxes
2. Set phone to Do Not Disturb
3. Headphones on (Bubble Shield Profile 2.0)
4. Choose low-traffic time: Tuesday/Wednesday 10 AM or 8 PM

#### Store Navigation (45-60 minutes)
1. **Perimeter First:** Start at produce, loop to dairy, meat, bakery
2. **Aisles Second:** Hit only aisles you need (pasta, canned goods, cereal)
3. **Frozen Last:** Grab frozen items right before checkout
4. **Checkout Strategy:** Self-checkout if available (less social interaction)

#### Post-Shop Recovery (20 minutes)
1. Unload groceries onto counter
2. **Put away perishables first:** Meat, dairy, frozen (everything else can wait)
3. Set 10-minute timer: put away as much as possible
4. When timer beeps: Stop. Leave rest on counter if needed. You did the important part.

---

### MEAL PREP: NO-COOK AND LOW-EFFORT OPTIONS

- Frozen pizza (oven 15 min)
- Microwaveable dinner (4 min)

**Rule:** Eating something > eating nothing. Frozen pizza is better than skipping meals.

<h2 id="hygiene">SECTION 3: PERSONAL HYGIENE</h2>

### The Core Problem

Sensory issues + executive dysfunction + depression = hygiene tasks feel impossible. The water temperature, the texture of soap, the effort of standing, the drying off, the getting dressed again... it's not laziness. It's system overload.

### The Solution: Tiered Hygiene System

**Not every day requires a full shower. Match hygiene to your capacity.**

---

### TIER 1: MINIMAL FUNCTION DAY (5 Minutes)

**When you can't shower but need to function.**

1. **Face Wipe:** Use face wipe or wet washcloth on face
2. **Deodorant:** Apply deodorant
3. **Teeth:** Brush teeth (2 min) OR use mouthwash if you can't brush
4. **Hair:** Dry shampoo if greasy, or pull back in ponytail/hat
5. **Clothes:** Clean underwear minimum (even if you re-wear shirt/pants)

**This is enough. You did the bare minimum to not feel gross. That counts.**

---

### TIER 2: SINK WASH (10 Minutes)

**When shower feels impossible but you want to feel cleaner.**

1. **Face:** Wash face with soap and water
2. **Armpits:** Wet washcloth + soap, scrub armpits
3. **Groin:** Wet washcloth + soap, quick wash
4. **Feet:** If they feel gross, quick rinse in sink or wipe down
5. **Deodorant:** Apply after washing
6. **Teeth:** Brush teeth (2 min)
7. **Hair:** If needed, lean over sink and rinse hair, or use dry shampoo
8. **Fresh Clothes:** Put on clean underwear + shirt at minimum

**You cleaned the important parts. This is valid hygiene.**

---

### TIER 3: QUICK SHOWER (15 Minutes)

**When you can manage a shower but need it fast.**

#### Pre-Shower Setup (2 minutes)
1. Set phone timer for 10 minutes
2. Put fresh clothes + towel within reach
3. Start water, get it to tolerable temperature
4. Undress

#### In-Shower Protocol (10 minutes)
1. **Wet hair and body** (1 min)
2. **Shampoo hair** (1 min scrub, 1 min rinse)
3. **Body wash:** Focus on armpits, groin, feet (3 min)
4. **Face wash:** Quick scrub with hands or washcloth (1 min)
5. **Rinse everything** (2 min)
6. **Done.** Exit when timer beeps.

**Skip:** Conditioner (unless hair is tangled), shaving, extended rinsing, standing under water zoning out

#### Post-Shower (3 minutes)
1. Towel dry (don't worry about perfect dryness)
2. Deodorant
3. Fresh clothes
4. Air-dry hair or quick towel scrunch (no blow dryer required)

---

5. Face wash (2 min)
6. Optional: Shave if needed (5 min)

---

### HYGIENE FREQUENCY GUIDE

**Adjust based on your actual capacity, not "shoulds."**

#### Daily Minimum (Tier 1 or 2)
- Brush teeth once (morning or night)
- Apply deodorant
- Change underwear
- Face wipe or wash

#### Every 2-3 Days (Tier 2 or 3)
- Full body wash (shower or sink)
- Wash hair OR dry shampoo
- Fresh clothes (shirt + pants)

#### Weekly (Tier 4)
- Full shower with hair wash
- Trim nails
- Change bed sheets
- Laundry (see house cleaning section)

**If you miss days:** Don't spiral. Just do Tier 1 today, Tier 2 tomorrow, Tier 3 when you can. Progress > perfection.

---

### SENSORY ACCOMMODATIONS

**If showers are hard due to sensory issues:**

- **Water Pressure:** Adjust to lower pressure, or use detachable shower head
- **Temperature:** Lukewarm is fine (doesn't have to be hot)
- **Time of Day:** Shower when you have most energy (morning, afternoon, night—doesn't matter)
- **Lighting:** Dim lights or shower in dark if bright lights are overwhelming
- **Sound:** Music or white noise to drown out water sound if it's too much
- **Texture:** Use soft washcloth instead of loofah, or just hands + body wash
- **Soap:** Unscented or low-scent soap if smells trigger you
- **Standing:** Sit on shower stool or edge of tub if standing is exhausting
