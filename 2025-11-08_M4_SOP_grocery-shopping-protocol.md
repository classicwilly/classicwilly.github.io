# GROCERY SHOPPING PROTOCOL (SOP-GS)

**Template-based shopping system for neurodivergent meal planning.**

---

## THE CORE PROBLEM

Grocery shopping requires:
1. Planning meals
2. Making lists
3. Driving to store
4. Navigating crowded aisles
5. Decision-making under sensory overload
6. Checkout social interaction
7. Unloading and putting away

**That's 7+ executive function tasks.** No wonder we eat cereal for dinner.

**This is not poor planning. This is system overload.**

---

## THE SOLUTION: TEMPLATE-BASED SHOPPING

**Stop planning meals. Use a template list.**

Instead of "what should I make this week?" (infinite possibilities = freeze), you check boxes on a pre-made list. Decision fatigue eliminated.

---

## MASTER GROCERY TEMPLATE

**Print this. Laminate it. Keep it on fridge.**

**Shopping Rule:** When 50% of boxes are checked, it's time to shop.

---

### PROTEINS (Pick 3-4 per shop)

**Low-Prep Options:**
- [ ] Eggs (18-count carton) - scramble, fry, boil
- [ ] Rotisserie chicken (1 whole, pre-cooked) - pull meat for 3-4 meals
- [ ] Deli meat: turkey or ham (1 lb) - sandwiches, wraps
- [ ] Canned tuna or salmon (4-6 cans) - mix with mayo, eat
- [ ] Peanut butter or almond butter (1 jar) - protein + fat, no cook

**Freezer Proteins:**
- [ ] Frozen chicken breasts (2 lb bag) - bake or microwave
- [ ] Ground beef or turkey (1-2 lbs) - brown in pan, use for multiple meals
- [ ] Frozen fish fillets (1 box) - bake 15 min

**Why these:** Pre-cooked, minimal prep, or single-step cooking. No elaborate recipes required.

---

### CARBS (Pick 3-4 per shop)

**Bread Products:**
- [ ] Bread (1-2 loaves) - sandwiches, toast
- [ ] Tortillas (1 pack, 10-12 count) - wraps, quesadillas, freezes well
- [ ] Bagels or English muffins (1 pack) - toast, spreads

**Pasta/Rice:**
- [ ] Pasta (2-3 boxes) - boil 8 min, add sauce
- [ ] Rice (1 bag or instant rice cups) - microwave or boil
- [ ] Instant ramen or noodles (6-12 packs) - emergency backup

**Cereal/Oats:**
- [ ] Oatmeal (1 container, instant packets OK) - microwave 2 min
- [ ] Cereal (1-2 boxes) - no-cook breakfast/dinner

**Snack Carbs:**
- [ ] Crackers (1-2 boxes) - pair with cheese, PB, tuna

**Why these:** Quick-cook or no-cook. Carbs = energy. These don't require planning.

---

### VEGETABLES (Pick 4-5 per shop)

**Zero-Prep Vegetables (eat raw):**
- [ ] Baby carrots (1-2 bags) - grab and eat, no cutting
- [ ] Cherry tomatoes (1 container) - pop in mouth, no cutting
- [ ] Cucumber (1-2, pre-sliced if available) - minimal cutting

**Minimal-Prep Vegetables:**
- [ ] Bagged salad (2-3 bags) - pre-washed, dump in bowl
- [ ] Broccoli florets (1-2 bags, pre-cut) - microwave or steam 3 min
- [ ] Bell peppers (2-3, pre-sliced if available) - raw or quick sauté

**Frozen Vegetables (ultimate low-effort):**
- [ ] Frozen mixed vegetables (2-3 bags) - dump in bowl, microwave 4 min
- [ ] Frozen broccoli or green beans (2 bags) - microwave, no cutting
- [ ] Frozen stir-fry mix (1-2 bags) - dump in pan, cook 5 min

**Canned Vegetables (backup):**
- [ ] Canned green beans (4 cans) - open, heat, eat
- [ ] Canned corn (4 cans) - open, heat or eat cold
- [ ] Canned diced tomatoes (2-3 cans) - use for pasta sauce

**Why these:** Eating vegetables shouldn't require knife skills. Pre-cut, frozen, or canned = accessible nutrition.

---

### FRUITS (Pick 2-3 per shop)

**Grab-and-Eat Fruits:**
- [ ] Apples (6-pack or bag) - rinse and eat
- [ ] Bananas (1 bunch) - peel and eat, no cutting
- [ ] Grapes (1 container) - rinse and eat
- [ ] Clementines or oranges (1 bag) - peel and eat

**Pre-Portioned Fruits:**
- [ ] Applesauce cups (6-12 pack) - open and eat
- [ ] Fruit cups in juice (6-pack) - open and eat
- [ ] Dried fruit: raisins, craisins (1-2 boxes) - snack

**Frozen Fruits:**
- [ ] Frozen berries (1-2 bags) - smoothies, oatmeal topping, or thaw and eat

**Why these:** Fruits = vitamins + easy snacks. These don't require cutting boards or meal planning.

---

### DAIRY (Pick 3-4 per shop)

**Milk Products:**
- [ ] Milk (1 gallon or 2 half-gallons) - cereal, oatmeal, drinking
- [ ] Yogurt cups (6-12 pack) - grab-and-eat breakfast/snack
- [ ] Cottage cheese (1 container) - high protein, eat with spoon

**Cheese:**
- [ ] Sliced cheese (1 pack) - sandwiches, quesadillas
- [ ] Shredded cheese (1-2 bags) - quesadillas, pasta, eggs
- [ ] String cheese (12-pack) - grab-and-eat snack

**Butter/Spreads:**
- [ ] Butter (1 box) - cooking, toast
- [ ] Cream cheese (1 container) - bagels

**Why these:** Dairy = protein + calcium. These are all single-step or no-prep.

---

### PANTRY STAPLES (Restock when low/out)

**Sauces:**
- [ ] Pasta sauce (2-4 jars) - pour on pasta, 30 seconds
- [ ] Mayo (1 jar) - sandwiches, tuna mix
- [ ] Ketchup, mustard (1 each if low)

**Canned Goods:**
- [ ] Canned soup (4-8 cans, variety) - open, heat 3 min, eat
- [ ] Mac and cheese boxes (4-6 boxes) - boil, add butter/milk, 8 min
- [ ] Canned beans (black, kidney, chickpeas) (2-4 cans) - protein source

**Oils/Seasonings:**
- [ ] Cooking oil (vegetable or olive)
- [ ] Salt, pepper (if out)
- [ ] Garlic powder (versatile seasoning)

**Beverages:**
- [ ] Coffee or tea (if you drink it)

---

### SNACKS (Pick 3-4 per shop)

- [ ] Chips or pretzels (2-3 bags)
- [ ] Popcorn (microwave bags or pre-popped)
- [ ] Cookies or crackers (1-2 packages)
- [ ] Trail mix or mixed nuts (1-2 bags)

**Why these:** Snacks prevent "too hungry to cook, ordering takeout" situations.

---

### DRINKS (Pick 2-3 per shop)

- [ ] Water bottles (24-pack) - hydration critical
- [ ] Juice or lemonade (1-2 bottles)
- [ ] Soda or sparkling water (12-pack)
- [ ] Sports drinks (6-pack)

**Why these:** Dehydration mimics ADHD symptoms. Keep hydration easy.

---

### FROZEN MEALS (Emergency Backup - Pick 2-3)

**When executive function fails completely:**
- [ ] Frozen pizzas (2-3) - oven 15 min
- [ ] Microwaveable dinners (4-8) - microwave 4 min
- [ ] Frozen burritos (1 bag) - microwave 2 min
- [ ] Hot Pockets or similar (1 box) - microwave 2 min
- [ ] Frozen lasagna or casserole (1-2) - oven 30-45 min

**Why these:** Some days, "nuke and eat" is the only option. That's valid.

---

## SHOPPING EXECUTION PROTOCOL

**Goal:** Get in, get out, minimize sensory overwhelm and decision fatigue.

---

### PRE-SHOP SETUP (5 minutes)

**Step 1: Prepare Template**
1. Pull out laminated grocery template
2. Check boxes for items you're low on or out of
3. Take photo of template with phone (backup list)

**Step 2: Set Phone to Do Not Disturb**
- Eliminates mid-shop distractions
- Reduces decision interruptions

**Step 3: Deploy Bubble Shield**
- Put on headphones (Soundcore Space One or whatever you have)
- Profile 2.0: Transparency 5, Volume 10% (hear announcements but filter crowd noise)
- OR: Earplugs if headphones aren't available

**Step 4: Choose Low-Traffic Time**
**Best times:**
- **Weekday mornings:** Tuesday or Wednesday, 10:00 AM - 12:00 PM
- **Weekday evenings:** Tuesday or Wednesday, 8:00 PM - 9:00 PM
- **Avoid:** Weekends, 5-7 PM weekdays, first of month, day before holidays

---

### STORE NAVIGATION (45-60 minutes)

**Strategy: Perimeter → Aisles → Frozen → Checkout**

#### Phase 1: Perimeter Loop (20 minutes)
1. **Produce section:** Grab vegetables and fruits (check template)
2. **Deli/Meat section:** Grab deli meat, rotisserie chicken, fresh meat
3. **Dairy section:** Grab milk, cheese, yogurt, butter
4. **Bakery section:** Grab bread, bagels, tortillas

**Why perimeter first:** Fresh items are on store edges. Get these while cart is empty.

#### Phase 2: Aisles (20 minutes)
**Only enter aisles you need.** Template tells you what aisles:
- **Pasta aisle:** Pasta, pasta sauce
- **Canned goods aisle:** Soup, beans, tuna, canned vegetables
- **Cereal aisle:** Cereal, oatmeal, granola bars
- **Snack aisle:** Chips, crackers, cookies
- **Condiment aisle:** Mayo, ketchup, mustard (if needed)

**Avoid:** Walking every aisle "just in case." Stick to template.

#### Phase 3: Frozen Section (10 minutes)
**Grab last to prevent thawing:**
- Frozen vegetables
- Frozen proteins (chicken, fish)
- Frozen meals (pizza, burritos, dinners)
- Frozen fruit

#### Phase 4: Checkout (10 minutes)
**Self-Checkout if available:**
- Scan items yourself
- Less social interaction
- Control pacing

**Regular Checkout if needed:**
- Choose shortest line
- Have payment ready (card in hand)
- Polite but minimal interaction ("Hi," "Thanks," done)

---

### POST-SHOP RECOVERY (20 minutes)

**You did a hard thing. Executive function is depleted. Execute minimal recovery protocol.**

#### Phase 1: Unload Groceries (5 minutes)
1. Bring bags from car to kitchen
2. Place all bags on counter or floor
3. Sit down for 2 minutes (seriously—rest)

#### Phase 2: Put Away Perishables ONLY (10 minutes)
**Critical items (will spoil if left out):**
- Meat → Fridge or freezer
- Dairy (milk, cheese, yogurt) → Fridge
- Frozen items → Freezer

**Everything else can wait.** Bread, pasta, cans, snacks—they're shelf-stable. Put away now OR later when you have capacity.

#### Phase 3: Rest or Continue (5 minutes)
**If you have energy:**
- Put away remaining items (pantry, cabinets)
- Break down boxes/bags

**If you don't have energy:**
- Leave remaining items on counter
- Set timer for 2 hours: "Put away groceries"
- Rest now, handle later

**It's okay to leave non-perishables out for a few hours.** You accomplished the hard part (shopping). Don't spiral over groceries sitting on the counter.

---

## MEAL PREP: NO-COOK & LOW-EFFORT OPTIONS

---

### BACKUP EMERGENCY MEALS (Zero Effort)

**When executive function = 0:**

**Option 1: Frozen Pizza**
- Preheat oven (temperature on box)
- Put pizza in oven (set timer per box, usually 12-15 min)
- Remove when timer beeps
- Eat from box if cutting feels too hard

**Option 2: Microwaveable Dinner**
- Open box, remove plastic tray
- Poke holes in film (per instructions)
- Microwave (time on box, usually 3-5 min)
- Let sit 1 min (hot!)
- Eat from tray

**Option 3: Canned Soup + Crackers**
- Open can of soup
- Pour in bowl
- Microwave 2-3 minutes
- Eat with crackers on the side

**Option 4: Frozen Burrito**
- Unwrap burrito
- Wrap in paper towel
- Microwave 2-3 minutes (flip halfway)
- Eat

**These are not failures. These are you feeding yourself when your brain is offline. That's success.**

---

## FREQUENCY & RESTOCKING

**How often to shop:** Every 7-10 days (weekly-ish)

**When to shop:**
- 50% of template boxes are checked (running low)
- You're eating frozen meals 3+ days in a row (stockpile depleted)
- You're ordering takeout because "there's no food" (system breakdown)

**Emergency option:** Grocery delivery
- Instacart, Walmart+, Amazon Fresh, etc.
- Use saved template photo as guide
- Pay extra $5-10 delivery fee if leaving house is too hard
- Valid survival strategy

---

## TROUBLESHOOTING

### "I can't make myself go to the store"

**Options:**
1. **Grocery delivery:** Pay for delivery, use template photo, avoid store entirely
2. **Buddy system:** Ask friend/family to shop with you (social body-doubling)
3. **Smaller shop:** Just buy 10 items (milk, eggs, bread, PB, cereal, carrots, apples, cheese, pasta, sauce). Survival rations for 3-4 days.

### "I bought food but can't make myself cook"

**You bought wrong items.** Next shop:
- Increase frozen meals (microwave only)
- Increase no-cook options (deli meat, cheese, bread, yogurt, fruit)
- Decrease "cooking required" items (raw meat, fresh vegetables that need chopping)

### "I keep ordering takeout even though I have food"

**Analysis:**
- Groceries require decisions (what to eat?) and steps (assembly/cooking)
- Takeout requires 1 decision (what restaurant?) and 0 steps (they deliver)
- **Solution:** Increase no-cook and 1-step meals (see lists above)

### "Food keeps going bad before I eat it"

**Buy less fresh, more frozen/canned:**
- Fresh produce spoils in 3-5 days → Frozen vegetables last months
- Fresh meat spoils in 2-3 days → Frozen meat lasts months
- Bread molds in 7 days → Freeze half the loaf, thaw slices as needed

---

## INTEGRATION WITH OTHER PROTOCOLS

### Weekly Review (Friday 3PM or Sunday 8:30PM)
- Check template: 50% boxes checked? Schedule grocery shop this week.
- Review: Did I eat frozen meals 4+ days? Need to restock.

### Daily Dump (10:25 PM)
- Note: "Ran out of milk today" → Check milk box on template tomorrow

---

## FINAL REMINDER

**Feeding yourself is not a moral issue.**

- Frozen pizza = you ate
- Cereal for dinner = you ate
- PB&J 3 days in a row = you ate

**This protocol exists to remove the shame and provide the structure. Use it.**
