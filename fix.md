# THE FIX-IT BLUEPRINT

**Stop patching. Start fixing.**

---

## WHO IS THIS FOR?

**Neurodivergent professionals drowning in chaos.**

You are:
- An ADHD/autistic professional managing complex workflows
- Overwhelmed by executive dysfunction and context switching
- Building systems that collapse under real-world pressure
- Tired of productivity advice that doesn't account for your brain
- Looking for structure that works *with* neurodivergence, not against it

You don't need motivation. You need **mechanical systems that run on autopilot when your brain can't.**

---

## WHAT YOU NEED

**A systems audit + custom protocol implementation.**

### The Problem:
Your current "system" is a collection of half-implemented tools, abandoned apps, and good intentions. When executive function fails, everything falls apart.

### What You Actually Need:
1. **Root cause diagnosis** - Find the single breakdown point collapsing your workflow
2. **Neurodivergent-aware protocols** - SOPs designed for brains that work in bursts, not flows
3. **Emergency procedures** - IPIs (Immediate Problem Instructions) for when you freeze
4. **Trackable metrics** - Daily check-ins that catch problems before catastrophic failure

### What You Get:
- **Systems Audit Report** - Detailed analysis of your current chaos
- **Custom SOP Package** - 3-5 protocols tailored to your workflow (Morning Routine, Task Capture, Weekly Review, Context Switching Recovery, etc.)
- **Emergency Protocol Set** - 2-3 IPIs for your most common failure modes (Executive Dysfunction, Sensory Overload, Burnout Recovery)
- **Implementation Guide** - Step-by-step deployment plan with fallback procedures

---

## HOW IT WORKS

**1-week diagnostic → Custom SOP delivery.**

### Week 1: The Chaos Intake (Days 1-2)

**90-minute diagnostic session** where you dump everything:
- Current workflows (what you're trying to do)
- Failure points (where it breaks down)
- Tools/apps you've tried and abandoned
- Neurodivergent-specific challenges (sensory issues, executive dysfunction patterns, masking burnout)

**My role:** Act as "bubble shield" - absorb all the data without judgment, listen for patterns your brain can't see when you're in the noise.

**Deliverable:** Voice-recorded session + written summary sent within 24 hours.

---

### Week 1: The Systems Analysis (Days 3-5)

**I disappear into my "card catalog" brain** and map your chaos:
- Identify the **root cause** (the single flawed assumption breaking everything)
- Find non-conforming conditions (where your actual behavior conflicts with your intended system)
- Design neurodivergent-compatible protocols (structure that works when executive function is offline)

**My method:** 15 years as a Navy systems diagnostician + lived experience with Autism/ADHD. I build systems that account for brain variability, not fantasy-land consistency.

**Deliverable:** Root Cause Analysis document (2-3 pages, plain language, no corporate BS).

---

### Week 1: The Fix Delivery (Days 6-7)

**You receive The Wonky Sprout Systems Blueprint:**

**Custom SOPs** (3-5 protocols):
- Formatted like Industrial Process Instructions (IPI) - numbered steps, no fluff
- Designed for low-executive-function states
- Include "if this fails, do this" fallback procedures
- Printable checklist versions for paper backups

**Emergency Protocols** (2-3 IPIs):
- Quick-reference cards for crisis states
- Example: "Executive Dysfunction Emergency" - 5-step reboot sequence
- Laminated-ready format for physical deployment

**Implementation Roadmap:**
- Week-by-week rollout plan (because trying to change everything at once = guaranteed failure)
- Metrics to track (daily check-ins, weekly reviews)
- Adjustment protocol (what to do when it's not working)

---

## INVESTMENT

**$1,500 for complete 1-week engagement.**

Includes:
- 90-minute diagnostic session
- Root cause analysis
- 3-5 custom SOPs
- 2-3 emergency IPIs
- Implementation guide
- 30-day email support for adjustments

**Payment:** 50% upfront, 50% on delivery.

**Guarantee:** If the protocols don't reduce your chaos by 50% within 30 days, I'll revise them for free or refund the second payment.

## WHO AM I?

**William Johnson (classicwilly)** - Systems Diagnostician, 40 years old, diagnosed Autism/ADHD.

**Background:**
- 15 years as Engineering Technician (Navy) - systems troubleshooting, root cause analysis, permanent fix implementation
- Built the **Wonky Sprout OS** to manage my own neurodivergent chaos (40+ protocols, 5 foundational SOPs, interactive daily tracker)
- "I hate group projects and usually do it all" - because my brain demands 11/10 or it breaks

**Philosophy:**
- Anti-BS. No corporate jargon, no motivational fluff.
- Structure from chaos. Your brain isn't broken; your systems are.
- Fix it once, fix it right. Permanent solutions, not recurring subscriptions.
