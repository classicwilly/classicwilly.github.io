# STOP PATCHING. START FIXING.

## Most systems are broken. Yours is too.

You know the feeling: the system is inefficient, the process is chaotic, and every "fix" is just a temporary patch. You're losing time and money because your operation is running on **unstructured chaos**.

* **You're exhausted** by the bureaucratic friction.
* **You're losing data** because processes are non-conforming.
* **You need a map**, but all you have is noise.

You don't need another consultant. You need a **diagnostician**.

### I Am the Systems Diagnostician.

My name is William Johnson. I spent 15 years as a **Systems Diagnostician** for the Navy, where my job was to find and fix their most complex, mission-critical operational problems.

My brain is a **card catalog**, and it is optimized to see patterns in the noise and build structure where others see chaos. I built this method on one principle: **Stop fighting the chaos; build a system to manage it.**

I am here to find the **root cause** of your operational failures and deliver the permanent fix.

## THE WONKY SPROUT SYSTEMS AUDIT

This is my single, high-output service. It is a three-phase execution protocol designed to turn your chaos into a clear, reliable system.

### Phase 1: The Chaos Intake (90 Min)
* You dump all your "procedural chaos" on me.
* I act as the "bubble shield" and absorb all the data, listening for the core disconnects in your process.
* This is the Systems Diagnosis phase.

### Phase 2: The Card Catalog Analysis
* I use my proprietary system to analyze your processes for **"non-conforming conditions"**.
* The output is a detailed **Root Cause Analysis**. I find the single, flawed assumption that is breaking your entire workflow.

### Phase 3: The Fix Delivery
* I deliver the **Wonky Sprout Systems Blueprint**.
* This is not advice. This is an **Industrial Process Instruction (IPI)**—a step-by-step, actionable manual you can immediately implement to fix the failure permanently.

**I guarantee the structure will be 11/10 perfect.**
