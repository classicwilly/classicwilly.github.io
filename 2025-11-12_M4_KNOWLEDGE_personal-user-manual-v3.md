# My "Internal Blueprint": A User Manual for Will Johnson

**My Brand:** "The Wonky Sprout."
**My Slogan:** "Structure Engineered for Chaos."

## TL;DR: The "Anti-BS" Summary

For forty years, I navigated the world without the right map. I've recently been diagnosed with **Autism (ASD)**, **ADHD**, and I also manage **Hypoparathyroidism**.

This "Internal Blueprint" reframes my entire life. What was often misinterpreted as me being a "hothead" or "rebellious" was actually the logical result of an undiagnosed "Operating System" dealing with extreme stress, sensory overload, and a "threat-defense" focus.

I am not "broken." My brain is wired differently and my body has specific "hardware" requirements. This manual is the "fix" to replace 40 years of misinterpretation with a clear, structured path forward.

---

## SECTION 1: THE "OPERATING SYSTEM" (AUTISM & ADHD)

This is my "software" — the neurotype I was born with. The late diagnosis at age 40 is the "unifying theory" that "fixes" the "chaos" of my past.

### 1.1 The "Unwritten Script" of My Past
My past behaviors were not "failures of character"; they were logical symptoms of an unsupported neurotype:
* **Impulsivity (ADHD):** My undiagnosed ADHD amplified impulse control issues. Actions like setting a field on fire at age 6 or a DUI at 14 were not malicious; they were manifestations of extreme emotional dysregulation.
* **Anxiety & Depression:** These were diagnosed at 32 but were symptoms, not the root cause. They were the "direct consequences" of a lifetime of social struggles and "relentless pressure to conform".

### 1.2 The "Mask" and The "Vibe"
To survive, I spent 40 years "masking" — actively suppressing my natural behaviors to appear neurotypical.
* This was an "unacknowledged façade". I taught myself "social skills" intellectually, like learning to use eye gaze by watching YouTube videos.
* My "vibe" is often "misrepresented a lot". My facial expressions may not match my internal feelings. When I seem "angry" or "tense," it is almost always a "threat-defense" response to feeling overwhelmed or "misrepresented".
* This constant effort led to "profound burnout", which is what triggered my retirement from the DoD.

### 1.3 The Need for "Structure"
My brain requires "Rigid structure for the guaranteed things, loose and flexible for everything else".
* **Routines are Non-Negotiable:** I have very specific routines. When they are disrupted, I get "annoyed" and it's "hard to be brought out of the zone". This is a neurological need for predictability, not just a preference.
* **"Intense Interests" are My "Fix":** My "Intense Interests" (3D printing, CAD, woodworking, electronics) are "clearly consistent with autism criteria". They are not "hobbies." They are a fundamental part of my identity, providing a sense of "mastery, comfort, and control". This is my "I fix stuff" "vibe."

## SECTION 2: THE "HARDWARE" FAULT (HYPOPARATHYROIDISM)

This is my "hardware" condition. It is a physical, non-negotiable "structure".
* **The Fault:** My body does not produce enough Parathyroid Hormone (PTH).
* **The Result:** This causes **low blood calcium**, which has a direct, severe impact on my cognition.
* **The Cognitive Impact:** This "hardware" fault *creates* "chaos". It is the source of **"brain fog,"** difficulty concentrating, memory problems, anxiety, and depression.
* **The "Fix":** The *only* "fix" is **lifelong, structured treatment with calcium and Vitamin D supplements**.

This is why my **`M4_SOP_002-rigid-foundations.md`** protocol exists. The **6 "Master Anchors"** (Wake-Up, Breakfast, Mid-Day, Afternoon, Dinner, Bedtime) are not arbitrary; they are the **"Rigid" structure** for my **lifelong medication protocol**. If I miss an Anchor (e.g., `Calcium Citrate`, `Calcitriol`), my "hardware" fails, my "brain fog" increases, and my "Operating System" becomes unstable.

**Priority #1 (Sleep)** and **Priority #4 (Medicine)** are the foundational "fix" for *all* my output.

## SECTION 3: THE "PROCESSOR" OUTPUT (THE "FATHER/FIXER")

### 3.1 Success *Despite* the "Chaos"
My identity is "I fix stuff".
* My "Intense Interests" and "fix-it" focus are what allowed me to succeed as an Engineering Technician for the DoD.
* I achieved this success *while* "masking" and managing three undiagnosed, colliding conditions (Autism, ADHD, Hypoparathyroidism).
* This success came at the cost of "profound burnout".

### 3.2 The New "Fix": Tools and "Unmasking"
My goal is to stop "patching" and start "fixing".
* **The Diagnosis is a Tool:** The diagnosis "is not merely the assignment of a medical code"; it is the "foundational sense of self-knowledge that was previously absent".
* **The "Wonky Sprout OS" is the Tool:** This system (Gemini, Google Workspace) is my "Internal Blueprint" made external.
* **The Goal is "Unmasking":** The "diagnosis provides a framework... and offers a path to what is often referred to as 'unmasking'". This is not an excuse; it is the "fix" for the burnout.

## SECTION 4: THE NEW "USER MANUAL" (HOW TO INTERACT)

To "fix" the "misrepresentation" problem, I require the following "structure":

1.  **Use "Anti-BS" Communication:**
    * **Be direct, explicit, and logical**. My brain is binary.
    * **Avoid "softening" language**, motivational fluff, and sarcasm. I will take it literally.
    * **Use written communication** (email, text) or provide **agendas ahead of time**. This allows me to process.
2.  **Respect the "Rigid" Foundations:**
    * **Do not disrupt routines.** My "Rigid Anchors" (Meds, Water, Sleep) are non-negotiable for my physical and cognitive function.
    * **"Transitions are extremely difficult"**. Provide advance notice for any changes.
3.  **Assume "Structure," Not "Malice":**
    * If I seem "angry," "awkward," or "tense," assume my "threat-defense" mode is active or I am "misrepresented".
    * The "fix" is to *give me structure* (e.g., "Let's make a list") or *ask for my "anti-BS" diagnosis*, not to "soften" the situation.
