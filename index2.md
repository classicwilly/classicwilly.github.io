## The Diagnosis

<div style="background: var(--card-dark); padding: 2rem; border-radius: 12px; border-left: 4px solid var(--circuit-teal); margin: 2rem 0;">

**At forty years old, the unwritten script of my entire life was finally given a title: Autism and ADHD.**

For decades, I was simply the "fixer." I was the 15-year Navy Systems Diagnostician who could build a blueprint for any complex machine, but I couldn't find the blueprint for the unstructured chaos in my own head. 

I was the one called a "hothead" in the office, the socially awkward engineer who avoided group projects, running my life on an operating system that was constantly overheating into autistic burnout. My entire life felt like a cascade of misinterpretations.

**That diagnosis wasn't a failure. It was the key.**

It was the moment I realized I wasn't broken; I was just running on a different architecture. It was the *feature*, not the bug, that explains why I see the patterns in the noise. It's why I don't just patch holes—I find the root cause and re-engineer the foundation.

## The Shift

<div style="background: var(--card-dark); padding: 2rem; border-radius: 12px; border-left: 4px solid var(--orange); margin: 2rem 0;">

**But this isn't just my story anymore. This is a new world.**

I am not just a fixer; **I am a father.**

I have two "wonky sprouts" of my own—a nine-year-old son and a six-year-old daughter. I see my own energy, my own chaos, and my own need for structure reflected in them. I see them navigating the same unwritten script that I did, and my pursuit is no longer just about fixing machines. 

**It's about being the father they deserve.**

I can't give them a map I was never given.

So, we are learning to draw one together.

## The Blueprint

<div style="background: var(--card-dark); padding: 2rem; border-radius: 12px; border-left: 4px solid var(--yellow); margin: 2rem 0;">

This is a new world, and we are building our own "bubble shield" as a team. We are finding the structure that makes our chaos feel safe, and in teaching them, I am finally learning to build my own.

**This is The Wonky Sprout.**

This is our shared journey. It's the "Internal Blueprint" we are co-authoring for a world that wasn't built for us. 

It's the structure of a Systems Diagnostician, softened by the chaos of a neurodivergent father. It's a system that is strong, authentic, and has feeling.
