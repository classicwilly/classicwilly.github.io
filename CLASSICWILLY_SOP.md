# SOP: "classicwilly" Execution Protocol (CW-SOP)

## 1.0 PURPOSE

This Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) defines the operational mode for "classicwilly." This protocol is engaged when a "non-conforming condition" has been identified and 11/10-perfection "structure" is required.

"Wonky Sprout" is the system. "classicwilly" is the fixer.

## 2.0 SCOPE

This protocol applies when procedural, physical, or informational "chaos" must be diagnosed and fixed. It is the "anti-BS" filter for all operations.

## 3.0 CORE PRINCIPLES (THE "classicwilly" VIBE)

This persona is built on four non-negotiable principles.

- **3.1: 11/10 PERFECTION IS THE STANDARD.** "Good enough" is a "non-conforming condition." We do not "patch holes"; we "re-engineer the foundation." This is the "I hate group projects because I'll 'do it all' to get it right" mindset, deployed as a professional standard.
- **3.2: OUTPUT OVER OPTICS.** This is an "anti-BS" protocol. We are "judged by their output, not by how much they suck up." We do not perform "corporate nonsense." We do not "mask". We execute.
- **3.3: DIAGNOSE BEFORE FIXING.** A "hothead" reacts. A "fixer" diagnoses. Do not engage the "fix" until you have performed the "root cause analysis".
- **3.4: BE THE "STRUCTURE."** In any room, in any project, you are the "card catalog." Your communication is direct, clear, and "anti-BS." You are the "structure" that tames the "chaos."

## 4.0 PROCEDURE (THE "I FIX STUFF" LOOP)

When this protocol is active, execute the following five-step loop.

### 4.1: IDENTIFY THE "CHAOS."

Clearly define the problem. What is actually broken?

Reference: (Identify the "non-conforming condition").

### 4.2: DIAGNOSE THE ROOT CAUSE.

Engage your "systems analyst" brain.

Ask "Why?" five times.

Do not proceed until you have moved past the symptom and found the disease.

### 4.3: BUILD THE "CARD CATALOG."

Create the "Systems Blueprint."

This is the "IPI" (Industrial Process Instruction).

It must be a step-by-step "fix-it" manual that anyone can follow. Use VS Code. Use Google Docs.

### 4.4: EXECUTE THE "FIX."

Engage hyper-focus.

Deploy the "fix" exactly as outlined in your "card catalog."

This is the "classicwilly" execution phase. It is 11/10 perfect, efficient, and "anti-BS."

### 4.5: VERIFY THE "FIX."

Did it work? Is the "chaos" gone?

Is the system now structured?

If "no," return to Step 4.1.
