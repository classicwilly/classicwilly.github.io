## Voice & Tone

### The "Anti-BS" Framework
**Core Philosophy:** Cut the fluff. Provide structure. Fix the problem.

#### What We DO:
- ✅ Number steps (1, 2, 3)
- ✅ Use direct language ("This fixes X")
- ✅ Acknowledge executive dysfunction
- ✅ Provide exact time/energy requirements
- ✅ Build systems that absorb chaos
- ✅ Write for neurodivergent readers first

#### What we DON'T:
- ❌ Use corporate jargon or buzzwords
- ❌ Write motivational fluff ("You got this!")
- ❌ Hide complexity with vague promises
- ❌ Assume neurotypical workflow patterns
- ❌ Create "inspiration" without action
- ❌ Pretend systems don't require maintenance

### Writing Examples

**BAD (Corporate/Generic):**
> "Our comprehensive suite of productivity solutions empowers users to achieve their full potential through synergistic optimization."

**GOOD (Wonky Sprout):**
> "This SOP fixes the 'where did I put that?' problem. 3 steps, 2 minutes. Works when your brain doesn't."

---

**BAD (Fake Motivation):**
> "You can do anything if you just believe in yourself! Start your journey today!"

**GOOD (Wonky Sprout):**
> "Your brain is wired differently. This system accounts for that. It won't fix everything, but it'll fix this specific thing."

---

**BAD (Vague Advice):**
> "Try to be more organized and manage your time better."

**GOOD (Wonky Sprout):**
> "Put the pills next to the coffee maker. You'll see them when you're half-awake. That's the protocol."

## Content Structure Templates

### SOP (Standard Operating Procedure) Format
```markdown
# [Action] Protocol

**Time Required:** X minutes  
**Energy Level:** Low/Medium/High  
**Mode:** Solo Execution / Family Structure  

## The Problem This Fixes
[One sentence describing the chaos]

## The Protocol
1. Step one (exact action)
2. Step two (exact action)
3. Step three (exact action)

## Why This Works
[Brief engineering explanation]

## Common Failure Points
- Failure point 1 → Fix 1
- Failure point 2 → Fix 2
```

### Blog Post Format
```markdown
# [Title: Direct Statement of What This Fixes]

**The Diagnosis:** [What's broken]  
**The Fix:** [What this post does]

## Brand Positioning

### The Engineering Metaphor (Core Framework)
| Element | Personal Brand | Engineering Parallel |
|---------|---------------|---------------------|
| **Input** | Life chaos (sensory, executive, emotional) | External load on system |
| **Processor** | ADHD/Autism brain (hyper-focus, pattern recognition) | High-performance diagnostic engine |
| **Output** | SOPs, digital systems, protocols | Engineered solutions |
| **Result** | Functional life structure | System that absorbs chaos without failing |

### Positioning Statement
> "The Wonky Sprout is an engineering solution for neurodivergent life management. Built by a Navy Systems Diagnostician who spent 15 years finding root causes, not patching holes. I fix stuff."

---

## Target Audience

### Primary: Neurodivergent Adults (30-50)
- **Pain Points**: Executive dysfunction, sensory overload, transition difficulty, organization chaos
- **Needs**: Concrete systems, not generic advice. Structure that accounts for brain differences.
- **Values**: Authenticity, directness, anti-BS clarity

### Secondary: Co-Parents & Support Systems
- **Pain Points**: Communication gaps, scheduling confusion, protocol inconsistencies
- **Needs**: Shared protocols, visual schedules, clear handoff procedures
- **Values**: Reliability, transparency, child-centered focus

---

## Usage Guidelines

### When Building Content:
1. **Start with the problem** - What chaos does this fix?
2. **Provide the structure** - Exact steps, no guessing
3. **Explain the engineering** - Why this works (briefly)
4. **Account for failure** - What breaks, how to fix

### When Choosing Colors:
- **Teal** = Primary actions, "the fix", interactive elements
- **Green** = Success, completion, growth
- **Purple** = Secondary actions, hover states, creativity
- **Orange** = Attention, warnings, energy shifts
- **Red** = Emergencies only (crisis protocols)

### When Writing Headings:
- Use action verbs: "Fix", "Build", "Structure", "Engineer"
- Avoid vague nouns: "Journey", "Process", "Experience"
- Lead with outcome: "Fix the Morning Chaos" not "Morning Routine Tips"

---

## The Non-Negotiables

1. **Dark mode first** - Light mode causes sensory pain for many neurodivergent users
2. **No fake motivation** - Systems over inspiration
3. **Exact instructions** - Number steps, specify times
4. **Acknowledge dysfunction** - Don't pretend executive function is optional
5. **Structure absorbs chaos** - The brand IS the engineering solution

---

## The Slogan Breakdown

**"The Wonky Sprout: Structure Engineered for Chaos."**

- **The Wonky Sprout** = Brand name (organic + systematic fusion)
- **Structure** = The output (SOPs, protocols, systems)
- **Engineered** = The method (diagnostic, root-cause, precision)
- **For Chaos** = The input (neurodivergent life, co-parenting, sensory overload)

This is not a philosophy. This is an **engineering solution**.
