# What the Hell is a 'Wonky Sprout'?

## It's not a bug. It's a feature.

My whole life has been an unwritten script. I've spent four decades navigating the world without a map.

At 40, I was diagnosed with Autism and ADHD.

This wasn't a medical label. It was the key to the script. It was the moment my entire life—all the chaos, the confusion, the intense interests, and the feeling of being "misrepresented a lot"—snapped into focus.

The "chaos" was real. It was a brain bombarded with every possible thought. It was the "hothead" reputation at a job that demanded "masking," which led to profound burnout.

Then, during meditation, I had an experience that changed everything. I watched my brain, in real-time, file itself like a card catalog.

### The "Card Catalog"

That's what The Wonky Sprout is: **A card catalog for a chaotic world.**

My brain is not linear; it’s a high-performance engine for processing multi-threaded, chaotic data. For a long time, I thought this was a weakness.

I was wrong.

It is an optimization. My diagnoses are not a bug; they are a *feature*. They are the "why" behind my ability to see the pattern in the noise. It is a machine that builds structure.

### The "Wonky Sprout"

This brand is the perfect blend of those two forces:

* **The "Wonky" (The Chaos):** The organic, creative, non-linear brain.
* **The "Sprout" (The Structure):** The mechanical, logical, "I fix stuff" mind. The gears, the circuits.

It's okay to be a little wonky.

### The "Fix"

This brand is my new operating system. It's built on a "strongly anti-BS" philosophy. It's about authenticity, not "corporate nonsense." It's about *output*, not "suck-ups."

I'm not a "guru." I'm a "systems diagnostician" who spent 15 years finding the root cause of complex engineering problems for the Navy.

This is my "card catalog." Welcome to The Wonky Sprout.
