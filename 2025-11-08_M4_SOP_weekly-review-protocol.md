# WEEKLY REVIEW PROTOCOL (WRP-SOP)

**Purpose**: Systematic end-of-week maintenance to review progress, process captured data, update systems, and plan the next week. This is the "systems maintenance" protocol that prevents chaos accumulation and keeps the Wonky Sprout OS running cleanly.

**Frequency**: Once per week
- **Solo Execution Mode**: Friday 3:00-4:00 PM (before Family Mode transition)
- **Family Structure Mode**: Sunday 8:30-9:30 PM (after kids' bedtime, before your sleep anchor)

**Duration**: 60 minutes (can compress to 45 if needed, but 60 is ideal)

**Classification**: Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) - Scheduled maintenance, not emergency protocol

<h2 id="overview">PROTOCOL OVERVIEW</h2>

This is a 5-phase review that processes the week's data, maintains system health, and sets up the next week for success. Each phase has a specific purpose and time allocation.

**Do not skip phases.** Each one addresses a different aspect of system maintenance.

---

<h2 id="setup">PRE-PROTOCOL SETUP (5 Minutes)</h2>

### Environment Preparation
- **Action**:
  1. Clear physical space at Command Center (move clutter, papers, dishes)
  2. Close all browser tabs and applications
  3. Open only these tools:
     - Google Keep (for processing captures)
     - Google Tasks (for task review)
     - NotebookLM (for filing permanent notes)
     - Your calendar
     - This SOP document
  4. Deploy Bubble Shield Profile 1.0 (Transparency 3, Vol 20%)
  5. Set phone to Do Not Disturb
  6. Set timer for 60 minutes
- **Why**: Weekly Review requires focus. Remove distractions and create clean workspace.
- **Tool**: Soundcore headphones, phone timer

---

<h2 id="phase1">PHASE 1: CHAOS PROCESSING (15 Minutes)</h2>

**Purpose**: Process all captured thoughts, notes, and random data from the week. Turn chaos into structured information.

### Step 1: Google Keep Chaos Audit (10 minutes)
- **Action**: Open Google Keep and review ALL notes from this week
- **For each note, ask**: "What is this and what do I do with it?"
  
**Processing Decision Tree**:
1. **Actionable Task** → Move to Google Tasks with deadline
2. **Project Idea** → Move to NotebookLM with tag "Ideas - [Module]"
3. **Reference Info** → Move to NotebookLM with tag "Reference - [Topic]"
4. **Already Handled** → Archive in Google Keep
5. **No Longer Relevant** → Delete
6. **Unclear/Need More Thought** → Tag "Review Next Week" and leave in Keep

**Processing Method**:
- Do NOT process notes in order of appearance
- Process in order of importance:
  1. Action items first (things you need to do)
  2. Project ideas second (things you want to build)
  3. Reference info third (things to remember)
  4. Everything else fourth
- **Goal**: Empty Google Keep of this week's unprocessed captures

### Step 2: Voice Recording Processing (5 minutes)
- **Action**: Open Soundcore AI Recorder app and review any recordings not yet transcribed/filed
- **Process**:
  1. Listen to recording or read AI transcription
  2. Extract key information
  3. File in Google Keep (if needs more processing) or Google Tasks (if actionable) or NotebookLM (if permanent)
  4. Delete recording from device after filing
- **Why**: Voice recordings pile up. Process weekly to prevent backlog.

**Phase 1 Success Metric**: Google Keep is empty (or only has "Review Next Week" items). All actionable items are in Google Tasks.

---

<h2 id="phase2">PHASE 2: TASK COMPLETION REVIEW (10 Minutes)</h2>

**Purpose**: Review what you accomplished this week, identify patterns, and celebrate wins.

### Step 3: Completed Task Audit (5 minutes)
- **Action**: Open Google Tasks and review all tasks marked "Completed" this week
- **For each completed task, note**:
  - Did it take more or less time than expected?
  - What made it easy or hard to complete?
  - Is this a recurring task that should be scheduled?
- **Track patterns**:
  - Which days were most productive?
  - Which types of tasks are you avoiding?
  - Which tasks consistently take longer than expected?
- **Why**: Completed tasks show what's working. Learn from them.

### Step 4: Incomplete Task Triage (5 minutes)
- **Action**: Review all tasks that are still marked "Not Completed"
- **For each incomplete task, ask**:
  1. **Is it still relevant?** 
     - Yes → Keep it
     - No → Delete it
  2. **Why didn't I complete it?**
     - Too vague → Rewrite with clear micro-actions
     - Too big → Break into smaller tasks
     - Wrong priority → Move to "Someday/Maybe" list
     - External blocker → Note blocker and follow up
  3. **Should it carry over to next week?**
     - Yes → Update deadline
     - No → Archive or delete
- **Goal**: Clean task list with only relevant, actionable items

**Phase 2 Success Metric**: You can explain why each incomplete task didn't get done and have a plan to address it (or delete it).

---

<h2 id="phase3">PHASE 3: SYSTEM HEALTH CHECK (10 Minutes)</h2>

**Purpose**: Review your SOPs and protocols to ensure they're still working. Identify what's breaking down.

### Step 5: Foundational Protocol Compliance (5 minutes)
- **Action**: Review the 5 Foundational Daily Protocols and assess compliance:
  1. **Water Protocol**: Did I drink water immediately upon waking every day?
  2. **Pill Protocol**: Did I take my pills every morning?
  3. **Capture Protocol**: Did I capture fleeting thoughts throughout the week?
  4. **Sleep Anchor**: Did I go to bed at 10:30 PM consistently?
  5. **Daily Dump**: Did I review tomorrow's tasks before bed each night?
- **For each protocol, rate compliance**: 
  - 7/7 days = Excellent
  - 5-6/7 days = Good
  - 3-4/7 days = Needs Attention
  - 0-2/7 days = Critical Failure
- **For "Needs Attention" or "Critical Failure"**: 
  - Identify the barrier (forgot, too tired, environment issue, lack of tools)
  - Plan one specific fix for next week

### Step 6: Mode-Specific Protocol Review (3 minutes)
- **If in Solo Execution Mode**: Review Solo Mode SOP compliance
  - Did I protect core work blocks (9-1, 2-5)?
  - Did I deploy Bubble Shield Profile 1.0 during focus time?
  - Did I maintain meal prep and exercise protocols?
- **If in Family Structure Mode**: Review Family Mode SOP compliance
  - Did I enforce Quiet Time Protocol (1-3 PM)?
  - Did I use Bubble Shield Profile 2.0 appropriately?
  - Did I maintain structured family schedules?
- **Rate compliance** (same scale as above)
- **Identify what broke down and why**

### Step 7: IPI Usage Tracking (2 minutes)
- **Action**: Review how many times you used emergency IPIs this week:
  - Executive Dysfunction Emergency Protocol
  - Context Switching Recovery Protocol
  - Sensory Overload Emergency Protocol
- **For each IPI used**:
  - How many times did I need it?
  - What triggered it?
  - Did it work?
  - Can I prevent the need for it next week?
- **Red Flag**: If you used any IPI more than 3 times this week, something systemic is broken. Root cause analysis required (see Phase 5).

**Phase 3 Success Metric**: You have a clear picture of what protocols worked, what failed, and why.

---

<h2 id="phase4">PHASE 4: WEEK AHEAD PLANNING (15 Minutes)</h2>

**Purpose**: Set up next week for success by reviewing schedule, identifying risks, and pre-allocating time.

### Step 8: Calendar Review (5 minutes)
- **Action**: Open calendar and review next week's schedule (Monday-Sunday)
- **For each scheduled event, ask**:
  1. **Is this event still necessary?** (Can I cancel or decline?)
  2. **What preparation does it require?** (Create task if needed)
  3. **What is the sensory/cognitive cost?** (High-demand event = plan recovery time after)
  4. **Does this conflict with my mode schedule?** (Solo vs Family mode expectations)
- **Add missing events**:
  - Meal prep time (if Solo Mode)
  - Quiet Time blocks (if Family Mode)
  - Exercise/movement
  - Weekly Review (for next week)
- **Why**: Unplanned week = reactive chaos. Pre-plan to maintain structure.

### Step 9: Priority Task Selection (5 minutes)
- **Action**: From your cleaned Google Tasks list, identify **3-5 Priority Tasks** for next week
- **Criteria for Priority Task**:
  - Has a deadline next week
  - Moves a major project forward
  - Has been postponed multiple weeks (clear it or delete it)
  - High impact on life/work quality
- **For each Priority Task**:
  - Assign to specific day
  - Estimate time required
  - Block time on calendar for completion
- **Why**: Without priorities, you'll default to easy/urgent tasks instead of important ones.

### Step 10: Risk Assessment (3 minutes)
- **Action**: Review next week and identify potential problems:
  - **Schedule risks**: Back-to-back meetings, no buffer time, overcommitted days
  - **Sensory risks**: High-stimulation events, long social days, travel
  - **Transition risks**: Mode switches mid-task, deadline clustering
  - **Health risks**: Poor sleep night expected, medication running low, illness
- **For each risk, create mitigation**:
  - Schedule risk → Cancel/reschedule one event or add buffer time
  - Sensory risk → Pre-schedule recovery time, deploy Bubble Shield preemptively
  - Transition risk → Use Context Switching Recovery Protocol
  - Health risk → Prep medication refill, plan low-demand backup day
- **Why**: Reactive problem-solving drains energy. Proactive mitigation preserves it.

### Step 11: Success Definition (2 minutes)
- **Action**: Write down (in Google Keep or journal):
  - "Next week will be successful if I accomplish these 3 things:"
    1. [Priority Task 1]
    2. [Priority Task 2]
    3. [Maintain foundational protocols]
- **Why**: Clear success criteria prevents aimless drifting and end-of-week disappointment.

**Phase 4 Success Metric**: Next week's calendar is structured, priority tasks are scheduled, and potential problems are mitigated.

---

<h2 id="phase5">PHASE 5: SYSTEM OPTIMIZATION (10 Minutes)</h2>

**Purpose**: Improve the Wonky Sprout OS based on this week's data. Make it better.

### Step 12: Pattern Recognition (5 minutes)
- **Action**: Look at Phases 1-4 data and ask:
  1. **What worked really well this week?** (Double down on it)
  2. **What consistently failed?** (Fix it or stop doing it)
  3. **What surprised me?** (New insight or unexpected result)
  4. **What am I avoiding?** (Task, person, activity you keep postponing)
- **Write down answers** in NotebookLM with tag "Weekly Review - [Date]"
- **Why**: Patterns are invisible day-to-day. Weekly review reveals them.

### Step 13: SOP Updates (3 minutes)
- **Action**: Based on this week's experience, identify if any SOP needs updating:
  - **Add new step**: "I keep forgetting to [X], should add it to [SOP]"
  - **Remove outdated step**: "I no longer need to [X], remove from [SOP]"
  - **Clarify confusing step**: "Step [X] in [SOP] is unclear, rewrite it"
- **Make the update immediately** (if quick) or add to Google Tasks as "Update [SOP]"
- **Why**: SOPs are living documents. Update them weekly to keep them accurate.

### Step 14: Wins & Gratitude (2 minutes)
- **Action**: Write down 3 things you accomplished this week (big or small)
  - Example: "Completed client report on time"
  - Example: "Used Executive Dysfunction Protocol successfully"
  - Example: "Got 7 hours of sleep 5 nights this week"
- **Why**: Neurodivergent brains fixate on failures. Force yourself to acknowledge wins.
- **Tool**: NotebookLM with tag "Wins - [Date]" (creates searchable archive of accomplishments)

**Phase 5 Success Metric**: You've identified at least one system improvement and documented it.

---

<h2 id="post">POST-PROTOCOL ACTIONS (5 Minutes)</h2>

### Step 15: Clean Slate Ritual (3 minutes)
- **Action**: 
  1. Close all tabs and apps
  2. Clear physical desk space
  3. Refill water bottle for Monday morning
  4. Plug in headphones to charge
  5. Set out pill organizer for next week
  6. Set alarm for Monday 6:00 AM
- **Why**: Clean ending to the week creates clean start to next week

### Step 16: Transition to Evening Protocol (2 minutes)
- **Action**: 
  - If Solo Mode → Begin mode transition prep (see Solo/Family Mode SOPs)
  - If Family Mode → Continue to Daily Dump (10:25 PM) and Sleep Anchor (10:30 PM)
- **Why**: Weekly Review is intense focus. Transition gently to rest mode.

---

<h2 id="mode">MODE-SPECIFIC ADJUSTMENTS</h2>

### Solo Execution Mode (Friday 3:00-4:00 PM)
- **Why this timing**: Completes before Family Mode transition at 4:00 PM
- **Adjustment**: Focus more on work task review and next week's project priorities
- **After protocol**: Execute Solo → Family mode transition (close laptop, change location, shift mindset)

### Family Structure Mode (Sunday 8:30-9:30 PM)
- **Why this timing**: After kids' bedtime (8:00 PM), before your Daily Dump (10:25 PM)
- **Adjustment**: Focus more on family schedule coordination and sensory budget planning
- **After protocol**: Execute Daily Dump → Sleep Anchor as normal

---

<h2 id="troubleshoot">TROUBLESHOOTING</h2>

### "I don't have 60 minutes"
- **Minimum viable Weekly Review (30 minutes)**:
  - Phase 1: 7 minutes (process only urgent captures)
  - Phase 2: 5 minutes (review incomplete tasks only)
  - Phase 3: Skip (unless critical failures obvious)
  - Phase 4: 10 minutes (calendar + 3 priority tasks only)
  - Phase 5: 3 minutes (write 3 wins only)
  - Post-Protocol: 5 minutes (clean slate)
- **Note**: Compressed version is better than skipping entirely, but full 60-minute version prevents chaos accumulation.

### "I keep skipping Weekly Review"
- **Root cause options**:
  1. **Timing is wrong**: Move to different day/time that has less conflict
  2. **Too long**: Use 30-minute compressed version until habit is established
  3. **Doesn't feel urgent**: Add to calendar as "blocked" time, treat like a meeting
  4. **Executive dysfunction**: If you can't start, execute Executive Dysfunction Emergency Protocol first
- **Fix**: Set recurring calendar event with 15-minute warning alarm

### "Weekly Review shows everything is broken"
- **If multiple Critical Failures in Phase 3**: You're in systems crisis mode
- **Action**:
  1. Stop trying to do everything
  2. Return to **foundational protocols only** for one week (water, pills, capture, sleep, daily dump)
  3. Skip all non-essential tasks
  4. Re-run Weekly Review next week to assess if foundation is stable
  5. **Only then** add mode-specific protocols back
- **Why**: Cannot fix advanced systems if foundation is broken. Rebuild from bottom up.

---

<h2 id="integration">INTEGRATION WITH OTHER PROTOCOLS</h2>

### Weekly Review → Daily Dump
- Weekly Review handles strategic planning (week-level)
- Daily Dump handles tactical execution (day-level)
- Both are required. Do not skip either.

### Weekly Review → Mode SOPs
- Weekly Review assesses whether mode SOPs are working
- If mode SOP consistently fails, Weekly Review is where you fix it
- Update mode SOPs based on Weekly Review insights

### Weekly Review → Emergency IPIs
- If IPI usage is high (3+ per week), Weekly Review identifies root cause
- Weekly Review is where you prevent future IPI needs through system optimization

---

<h2 id="tools">TOOLS REQUIRED</h2>

- Google Keep (chaos capture review)
- Google Tasks (task management)
- NotebookLM (permanent filing)
- Calendar (schedule review and planning)
- Soundcore Space One headphones (focus)
- Phone timer (time boxing)
- This SOP document (protocol reference)

---

<h2 id="metrics">SUCCESS METRICS</h2>

**You have successfully executed this protocol when:**
- Google Keep is empty (or only has "Review Next Week" items)
- All incomplete tasks are triaged (kept, updated, or deleted)
- You identified what worked and what failed this week
- Next week's calendar is structured with priority tasks scheduled
- You documented at least one system improvement

**This protocol is NOT designed to:**
- Make you feel guilty about what you didn't accomplish (focus on patterns, not failures)
- Take longer than 60 minutes (time-box aggressively)
- Replace daily task management (that's Daily Dump's job)

**This is preventative maintenance. Run it weekly to prevent chaos accumulation.**

<h2 id="final">FINAL NOTE</h2>

**Weekly Review is the maintenance protocol that keeps the Wonky Sprout OS running cleanly.** Without it, chaos accumulates, protocols drift, and systems break down.

**This is not optional. This is how the system stays functional.**

**Run it every week. No exceptions.**

**Now execute it.**
