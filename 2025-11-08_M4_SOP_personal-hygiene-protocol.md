<h2 id="problem">THE CORE PROBLEM</h2>

Sensory issues + executive dysfunction + depression = hygiene tasks feel impossible.

It's not the hygiene itself. It's:
- The water temperature (too hot, too cold, never just right)
- The texture of soap (sticky, slimy, residue feeling)
- The effort of standing (exhausting when depressed)
- The drying off (wet towel texture, cold air)
- The getting dressed again (choosing clothes, wet skin on fabric)

**This is not laziness. This is system overload.**

---

<h2 id="solution">THE SOLUTION: TIERED HYGIENE SYSTEM</h2>

**Not every day requires a full shower. Match hygiene to your capacity.**

- **Tier 1:** Minimal function (5 min) - Can't shower, need to survive
- **Tier 2:** Sink wash (10 min) - Shower impossible, want to feel cleaner
- **Tier 3:** Quick shower (15 min) - Can manage shower but need it fast
- **Tier 4:** Full routine (30-45 min) - Have capacity for complete maintenance

**Use the tier that matches your energy. Lower tier ≠ failure.**

---

<h2 id="tier1">TIER 1: MINIMAL FUNCTION DAY (5 Minutes)</h2>

**When to Use:** Can't shower. Depression, exhaustion, executive dysfunction freeze. Need to survive today.

**Goal:** Do minimum to not feel gross. That's it.

---

### THE PROTOCOL

**Tools:** Face wipes, deodorant, toothbrush, dry shampoo (optional), clean underwear

**Step 1: Face Wipe (1 minute)**
- Use face wipe OR wet washcloth
- Wipe face: forehead, cheeks, nose, chin
- Toss wipe or hang washcloth

**Step 2: Deodorant (30 seconds)**
- Apply deodorant to armpits
- This is the #1 thing that makes you not smell

**Step 3: Teeth (2 minutes)**
- Brush teeth for 2 minutes (set timer if needed)
- Can't brush? Use mouthwash for 30 seconds (better than nothing)

**Step 4: Hair (1 minute)**
- Hair greasy? Spray dry shampoo at roots, massage in
- OR: Pull hair back in ponytail, bun, or wear hat
- Don't have dry shampoo? Hat/ponytail still works.

**Step 5: Clothes (30 seconds)**
- Put on clean underwear (minimum)
- Re-wearing shirt/pants from yesterday? That's fine. Fresh underwear is the critical item.

**Total: 5 minutes. You did enough.**

---

### VALIDATION

This tier is for survival, not performance. You:
- Don't smell (deodorant)
- Don't have visible face grease (wipe)
- Don't have bad breath (teeth/mouthwash)
- Have clean underwear

**You are clean enough to exist in the world. This counts.**

---

<h2 id="tier2">TIER 2: SINK WASH (10 Minutes)</h2>

**When to Use:** Shower feels impossible but you want to feel cleaner than Tier 1.

**Goal:** Wash the important parts without full shower.

---

### THE PROTOCOL

5. Pat face dry with towel

**Step 2: Armpit Wash (2 minutes)**
1. Wet washcloth with warm water, add soap
2. Scrub armpits thoroughly (lift arm, scrub in circular motion)
3. Rinse washcloth, wipe off soap residue

2. Quick wash of groin area (private, no detail needed here—you know what to do)
3. Rinse washcloth, wipe off soap
4. Pat dry with towel

---

### VALIDATION

You washed:
- Face (visible to others)
- Armpits (smell source)

- Teeth (bad breath gone)

**This is valid hygiene. You don't need a shower to be clean.**

---

<h2 id="tier3">TIER 3: QUICK SHOWER (15 Minutes)</h2>

**When to Use:** Can manage a shower but need it to be fast. Low energy, limited time, or shower avoidance but forcing yourself.

**Goal:** Get in, wash critical areas, get out. No lingering.

---

### PRE-SHOWER SETUP (2 minutes)

---

<h2 id="frequency">HYGIENE FREQUENCY GUIDE</h2>

**How often should you do each tier?**

### Daily Minimum (Every Day)
- **Tier 1 minimum:** Face wipe, deodorant, teeth, clean underwear
- If you can't do more, this is enough

### Every 2-3 Days (Recommended)
- **Tier 2 or 3:** Full body wash (sink wash or quick shower)
- Wash hair OR use dry shampoo
- Fresh clothes (shirt + pants)

### Weekly (Recommended)
- **Tier 4:** Full shower with hair wash
- Trim nails (fingernails and toenails)
- Change bed sheets (see House Cleaning SOP)
- Full laundry (see House Cleaning SOP)

---

### WHAT IF YOU MISS DAYS?

**Don't spiral. Don't try to "catch up."**

- Missed 3 days of showering? → Do Tier 1 today, Tier 2 tomorrow, Tier 3 when you can.
- Missed a week? → Do Tier 2 today (sink wash), Tier 3 tomorrow.
- Skipped teeth for 2 days? → Brush tonight, brush tomorrow morning. You're back on track.

**Progress > Perfection. Forward momentum > shame.**

---

<h2 id="sensory">SENSORY ACCOMMODATIONS</h2>

**If showers are hard due to sensory issues, adapt the environment:**

### Water Issues
- **Pressure too intense:** Lower water pressure, or use detachable shower head (control flow)
- **Temperature sensitive:** Lukewarm is fine (doesn't have to be hot)
- **Water sound overwhelming:** Play music or white noise to drown it out

### Lighting
- **Bright lights overwhelming:** Shower in dim light or darkness
- **Prefer bright:** Use bright bathroom light if it helps you stay alert

### Time of Day
- **Morning showers:** If you have most energy in morning
- **Evening showers:** If morning is too hard
- **Midday showers:** If that's when you have capacity
- **No "correct" time—just when you can do it**

### Texture Issues
- **Loofah/washcloth too rough:** Use just hands + body wash
- **Body wash texture bad:** Try bar soap or different brand
- **Towel texture bad:** Air-dry partially, use softer towel, or pat gently instead of rubbing

### Soap Sensitivity
- **Scents trigger you:** Use unscented soap, shampoo, body wash
- **Soap residue feeling:** Rinse longer (extra minute under water)
- **All soap feels bad:** Just water is fine for a day (better than no shower)

### Standing Difficulty
- **Exhausted/depressed:** Sit on shower stool, edge of tub, or floor (if safe)
- **Balance issues:** Install grab bar, use non-slip mat
- **Can't stand long:** Do Tier 3 (10-minute quick shower) sitting down

---

<h2 id="troubleshoot">TROUBLESHOOTING</h2>

### "I haven't showered in a week and I feel disgusting"

**Don't jump to Tier 4. That will overwhelm you.**

**Today:** Tier 2 (10-minute sink wash)  
**Tomorrow:** Tier 3 (15-minute quick shower)  
**Day 3:** Resume Tier 1 daily, Tier 3 every 2-3 days

**You broke the freeze. That's the hard part. Now maintain.**

---

### "Showers trigger my depression/anxiety"

**Analysis:** Shower = forced alone time with your thoughts. Brain spirals.

**Solutions:**
1. **Distraction:** Play loud music or podcast (drown out thoughts)
2. **Timer:** Set 10-minute timer (prevents zoning out/spiraling)
3. **Task focus:** Narrate steps out loud ("Now I'm washing my hair. Now I'm rinsing.")
4. **Alternative:** Tier 2 sink wash (faster, less alone time)

---

### "I shower but then can't get dressed"

**Analysis:** Shower depletes executive function. Getting dressed = too many decisions.

**Solutions:**
1. **Pre-pick outfit:** Choose clothes BEFORE shower, lay them out
2. **Uniform dressing:** Same outfit type every day (black shirt + jeans, etc.)
3. **Minimal clothing:** Underwear + oversized shirt + shorts (comfort > fashion)
4. **Rest period:** Sit for 5 minutes after shower before dressing

---

### "I can't brush my teeth—texture/gag reflex"

**Alternatives:**
1. **Mouthwash only:** 30-second swish (kills bacteria, freshens breath)
2. **Softer toothbrush:** Use kids' toothbrush (smaller, softer bristles)
3. **Different toothpaste:** Try different flavors (mint, bubblegum, cinnamon) or unflavored
4. **Electric toothbrush:** Some people find vibration easier than manual brushing
5. **Finger brush:** Wet finger, add toothpaste, rub on teeth (better than nothing)

---

### "Dry shampoo doesn't work for my hair type"

**Alternatives:**
1. **Water rinse:** Lean over sink, rinse hair with just water (no shampoo)
2. **Scalp wipe:** Use face wipe or damp washcloth on scalp (removes oil)
3. **Hat/headband:** Cover greasy hair until you can wash
4. **Baby powder:** If dry shampoo doesn't work, baby powder absorbs oil (use sparingly)

---

<h2 id="integration">INTEGRATION WITH OTHER PROTOCOLS</h2>

### Morning Routine (6:00-7:00 AM)
- **Tier 1 minimum:** Face wipe, deodorant, teeth, clean underwear

### Evening Routine (10:00-10:15 PM)
- **Tier 1 or 2:** Teeth brush, face wash (before bed hygiene)

### Weekly Schedule
- **Every 2-3 days:** Tier 3 quick shower (or as needed)
- **Sunday 10:00 AM:** Tier 4 full routine (if capacity allows)

### Daily Dump (10:25 PM)
- Note: "Skipped shower today" → Schedule Tier 2 or 3 for tomorrow

---

<h2 id="reminder">FINAL REMINDER</h2>

**Your hygiene is not your worth.**

- Skipped shower ≠ bad person
- Tier 1 day ≠ failure
- Dry shampoo for 4 days ≠ gross

**This protocol exists to remove shame and provide structure. Use it. Adapt it. Survive.**
