# MLP-006: "Priority #5" Legal "Fix-It" Protocol

## 1.0 PURPOSE (THE "FIX")

To "fix" [cite: 2025-11-10_M4_CONFIG_gemini-master-bootstrap-v2.md] the "unstructured chaos" [cite: 2025-11-10_M4_CONFIG_gemini-master-bootstrap-v2.md] of the November 2025 legal threat.

This protocol overrides all "loose" [cite: 2025-11-10_M4_CONFIG_gemini-master-bootstrap-v2.md] work in **Mode 1 (Solo Execution)** [cite: 2025-11-10_M4_CONFIG_gemini-master-bootstrap-v2.md] until the "Hearing" anchor is complete.

The **Primary Principle** is **Priority #5 (Children)** [cite: 2025-11-10_M4_CONFIG_gemini-master-bootstrap-v2.md]. The goal is to shift the narrative, "fix" the "Tool Threat," and protect the "kids money" [cite: 2025-11-10_M4_KNOWLEDGE_legal-brief-synthesis-v2.md].

## 2.0 RIGID ANCHORS (THE "STRUCTURE")

* **Anchor A (Meeting):** Wednesday, Nov 12 @ 1:00 PM (with Mr. Welch).
* **Anchor B (Hearing):** Thursday, Nov 13 @ 9:00 AM.
* **Support Anchor:** Mom (MUST CONFIRM BY 6 PM TODAY - Call if no text response).

## 2.1 FAILURE CONTINGENCIES

* **If Mom unavailable:** Identify backup support person by 6 PM Monday. Options: [Add names here].
* **If lawyer rejects structure:** "I need this to communicate effectively due to neurodivergence. This is my ADA accommodation."
* **If printing fails:** Email copies to phone, have digital backup ready.
* **If frozen at hearing:** Hand Mom your copy, point to specific section, let her read it.

## 3.0 KEY ASSET (THE "INTERNAL BLUEPRINT")

* `2025-11-10_M4_KNOWLEDGE_legal-brief-synthesis-v2.md`
* This file *is* the "structure" [cite: 2025-11-10_M4_CONFIG_gemini-master-bootstrap-v2.md]. It is the "anti-BS" [cite: 2025-11-10_M4_CONFIG_gemini-master-bootstrap-v2.md] agenda. It is non-negotiable.

## 4.0 EXECUTION WORKFLOW (THE "FIX-IT" IPI)

### Phase 1: Monday (FIX THE ANCHORS)
* **[X]** "Fix" meeting time with Mr. Welch. **(DONE: Wed 1 PM)**
* **[ ]** "Fix" confirmation from Mom (Support Anchor). **(CRITICAL: Call by 6 PM if no text response)**

* **[ ]** Define backup support person if Mom unavailable. **(DEADLINE: 6 PM TODAY)**

### Phase 2: Tuesday (STRUCTURE PREPARATION)

* **WORK BLOCK 2 (Review - TIMEBOX 3 HOURS MAX):**
    1.  Review `...legal-brief-synthesis-v2.md` using this checklist:
        * [ ] All dates/amounts verified (TSP, penalties, timeline)
        * [ ] Tool Threat section has Gemini counter-narrative (see Section 5.0)
        * [ ] Each misconduct allegation has citation
        * [ ] Mom can understand without explanation
        * [ ] Document prints cleanly (formatting, page breaks)
    2.  **STOP at 90% perfection** - Perfect is the enemy of done.

    2.  **Deliver "Structure":** Hand him his copy of the `v2` file.
    3.  **Execute Agenda:** Walk through each section. Focus on these outcomes:
        * **Tool Threat (Gemini):** Use counter-narrative from Section 5.0. Get his agreement on strategy.
        * **Wednesday Success = These 3 things locked in:**
          - [ ] Strategy for OC's Gemini history request (our response)
          - [ ] Talking points for Thursday hearing (what we're arguing)
          - [ ] His confirmation Mom can attend as support person
    4.  **If he resists the structure approach:** "This is my ADA accommodation. I need this to communicate effectively."
* **SHUTDOWN (9:45 PM):**

    3.  **Restore Anchors 3-6** if still broken.
* **GOAL:** Get back to Priority #5 (Children) - spending time with your kids without this bullshit hanging over you.

## 5.0 GEMINI "TOOL THREAT" COUNTER-NARRATIVE

**For Wednesday meeting with Mr. Welch - read this verbatim if needed:**

"The opposing counsel's request for my Gemini history is a distraction tactic. Here's the reality:

1. **Gemini is a research tool**, like Westlaw or legal dictionaries. It helps me process complex information faster given my documented cognitive disabilities (ASD/ADHD).

2. **Using AI for legal research is standard practice now.** Lawyers across the country use AI tools. The difference is I'm transparent about it.

3. **This is an ADA accommodation.** My disability makes processing complex legal information under time pressure extremely difficult. Gemini helps me participate meaningfully in my own defense.

4. **OC's request is a fishing expedition** designed to distract from the substantive issues: their financial sabotage, fraud on the court regarding the RBCO, and ADA retaliation.

5. **My proposed response:** 'My use of AI research tools is protected as a reasonable accommodation under the ADA. The request is irrelevant to the substantive issues and is denied.'

**Do you agree with this approach, or do you have a better strategy?"
