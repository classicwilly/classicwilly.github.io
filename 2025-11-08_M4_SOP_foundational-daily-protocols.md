<h2 id="overview">PROTOCOL OVERVIEW</h2>

These 5 protocols are **mandatory** and must execute in sequence or at designated times. They are the scaffolding that keeps executive function online.

---

<h2 id="morning">MORNING SEQUENCE (Fixed Order)</h2>

### 6:00 AM - Wake & Water Protocol
- **Purpose**: Physical Fix - Prevents dehydration chaos (crucial for focus)
- **Action**: 
  1. Wake alarm sounds
  2. Immediately drink 1 full glass (16 oz) of water
  3. Keep filled water bottle at Command Center for continuous hydration
- **Tool**: 32 oz water bottle (refilled night before)
- **Duration**: 2 minutes
- **Non-Negotiable**: This happens before phone, before anything else

### 6:02 AM - Pill Protocol
- **Purpose**: Health Fix - Ensures stable executive function from medication/supplements
- **Action**:
  1. Take all pills from daily organizer slot (vitamins, medications)
  2. Refill tomorrow's slot if needed
  3. Visual check: Organizer in correct position
- **Tool**: 7-day pill organizer (positioned at Command Center)
- **Duration**: 1 minute
- **Non-Negotiable**: Must happen immediately after water, no delay

<h2 id="all-day">ALL-DAY PROTOCOL (Active 6:00 AM - 10:30 PM)</h2>

### Capture Protocol (Always Running)
- **Purpose**: Thought Fix - Stops "fleeting thoughts" chaos and prevents loss of valuable data
- **Trigger**: Any thought, idea, or task that enters your mind
- **Action**:
  1. Stop whatever you're doing
  2. Grab Soundcore AI Recorder OR open Google Keep
  3. Record/write the thought immediately
  4. **DO NOT** process it—just capture it
  5. Return to current task
- **Tools**: 
  - Soundcore AI Voice Recorder (voice capture)
  - Google Keep (text capture)
- **Duration**: 30 seconds per capture
- **Note**: Processing happens during "Planning & Filing" time block

<h2 id="evening">EVENING SEQUENCE (Fixed Order)</h2>

### 10:00 PM - Sleep Anchor Prep
- **Purpose**: Regulator Fix - Ensures neuroplasticity and stable function
- **Action**:
  1. Begin winding down (low light, low stimulation)
  2. Turn off all screens
  3. Dim all lights in living space
  4. Engage low-stimulation activity (reading, meditation, stretching)
- **Tool**: Phone alarm (9:55 PM warning)
- **Duration**: 30 minutes
- **Non-Negotiable**: This is the beginning of sleep routine, not bedtime

### 10:25 PM - Daily Dump
- **Purpose**: Mental Fix - Clears cognitive load and prevents "chaos" from running while you sleep
- **Action**:
  1. Open Google Tasks
  2. Review tomorrow's schedule
  3. Write down the 3 most critical tasks for tomorrow
  4. Close all apps
- **Tool**: Google Tasks (mobile or desktop)
- **Duration**: 5 minutes
- **Non-Negotiable**: Must happen before 10:30 PM bedtime anchor

### 10:30 PM - Sleep Anchor
- **Purpose**: Final sleep trigger - Brain expects shutdown at this time
- **Action**:
  1. Phone on silent/DND mode
  2. Lay down in bed
  3. No screens, no stimulation
  4. Sleep
- **Tool**: Consistent bedtime anchor
- **Duration**: 7-8 hours (wake at 6:00 AM)
- **Non-Negotiable**: This is the most critical anchor for neuroplasticity
