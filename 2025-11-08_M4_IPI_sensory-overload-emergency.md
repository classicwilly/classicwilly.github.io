title: Sensory Overload Emergency Protocol
---

# SENSORY OVERLOAD EMERGENCY PROTOCOL (IPI-SO)

**Trigger**: The environment has become unbearable. Your nervous system is overloaded. You need immediate sensory reduction or you will shut down completely.

**Purpose**: This is the emergency protocol for acute sensory overload. It provides immediate actions to reduce sensory input, deploy protective tools, and retreat to safety before reaching full meltdown/shutdown.

**Classification**: Immediate Problem Instruction (IPI) - Execute as soon as overload is recognized. Speed is critical.

---

## RECOGNITION SIGNALS

You are in Sensory Overload Emergency if **3 or more** of these are true:

### Auditory Overload
- [ ] Normal conversation volume feels like shouting
- [ ] Background noise (HVAC, traffic, music) is physically painful
- [ ] Multiple sound sources are happening simultaneously and you can't filter them
- [ ] You feel an urge to cover your ears or escape the room

### Visual Overload
- [ ] Lights feel too bright, even normal indoor lighting
- [ ] Movement in your peripheral vision is deeply distracting
- [ ] Screens are causing eye strain or headache
- [ ] You want to close your eyes or seek darkness

### Tactile Overload
- [ ] Your clothing feels wrong (tags, seams, tightness, texture)
- [ ] You want to remove your clothes or change immediately
- [ ] Touch from others is irritating or painful
- [ ] Your skin feels hypersensitive to air, fabric, or contact

### Olfactory/Gustatory Overload
- [ ] Smells that normally don't bother you are overwhelming (cooking, cleaning products, perfume)
- [ ] You feel nauseous from scents
- [ ] Food tastes/textures are repulsive when normally they're fine
- [ ] You can't tolerate eating or can only tolerate specific bland foods

### Systemic Overload (Multiple Senses)
- [ ] You feel trapped, cornered, or claustrophobic
- [ ] Your fight-or-flight response is activated (heart racing, breathing shallow)
- [ ] You're irritable, snappy, or on the edge of tears/rage
- [ ] You need everyone to stop talking, stop moving, stop existing near you
- [ ] You're dissociating (feeling disconnected, foggy, watching yourself from outside)

**If 3+ signals present: Execute this protocol immediately. Do not wait. Do not tough it out.**

## OVERLOAD SEVERITY LEVELS

### Level 1: Discomfort (Preventable)
- Noticing sensory input is bothering you
- Can still function but energy is draining fast
- **Action**: Deploy Bubble Shield + Environment Modifications (Phase 1)

### Level 2: Distress (Urgent)
- Actively struggling to function
- Feeling desperate for sensory reduction
- **Action**: Execute Phases 1-2 immediately

### Level 3: Emergency (Critical)
- On the verge of meltdown or shutdown
- Cannot continue current activity
- **Action**: Execute all phases + Retreat Protocol

**DO NOT wait for Level 3. Act at Level 1.**

---

## PHASE 1: IMMEDIATE SENSORY REDUCTION (30-60 Seconds)

**Purpose**: Deploy protective tools to create instant sensory buffer.

### Step 1: Bubble Shield Emergency Deployment (10 seconds)
- **Action**: Put on headphones IMMEDIATELY
  - **If Solo Mode**: Profile 1.0 (Transparency 3, Vol 20%) with noise-canceling maxed
  - **If Family Mode**: Profile 2.0 (Transparency 5, Vol 10%)
  - **If Level 3 Emergency**: Profile 1.0 regardless of mode. Full isolation needed.
- **Why**: Auditory input is the easiest to control. Remove it instantly.
- **Tool**: Soundcore Space One headphones (keep accessible at all times)

### Step 2: Visual Reduction (15 seconds)
- **Action**: Execute ALL that apply:
  - Close eyes for 5 seconds (if safe to do so)
  - Look down at floor (reduces peripheral visual input)
  - Turn away from bright lights, screens, or movement
  - Put on sunglasses if available (even indoors)
- **Why**: Visual processing is the highest energy consumer. Reduce load immediately.
- **Tool**: Sunglasses (keep at Command Center)

### Step 3: Verbal Signal (5 seconds)
- **Action**: If others are present, say ONE of these:
  - "I need quiet right now."
  - "Sensory overload. Give me space."
  - "I need to step away."
- **If nonverbal**: Hold up hand in "stop" gesture and leave room
- **Why**: Others cannot read your mind. Clear signal prevents confusion and additional demands.

### Step 4: Immediate Escape (30 seconds)
- **Action**: Move to the nearest low-sensory location:
  - **If at home**: Your designated Retreat Location (Step 9)
  - **If at work**: Bathroom, empty conference room, car, outside
  - **If in public**: Bathroom, car, quiet corner, outside
- **Why**: You cannot regulate in the same environment that caused the overload. Leave immediately.
- **Non-Negotiable**: Do not try to power through. Escape is not weakness. It's damage control.

**Total Phase 1 Time: 30-60 seconds**

---

## PHASE 2: ENVIRONMENT RESET (2-5 Minutes)

**Purpose**: Create a sensory-controlled environment for nervous system regulation.

### Step 5: Location Security (30 seconds)
- **Action**: Once in your retreat location:
  - Close door (if available)
  - Lock door (if safe and possible)
  - Turn off or dim lights
  - Sit or lie down on floor/ground
- **Why**: Physical safety signals to your nervous system that you're no longer under threat
- **Non-Negotiable**: Prioritize lying down if possible. Horizontal position aids regulation.

### Step 6: Tactile Comfort Protocol (60 seconds)
- **Action**: Address tactile discomfort immediately:
  - Remove uncomfortable clothing items (shoes, socks, belt, bra, tight clothing)
  - Add comfortable layers if cold (hoodie, blanket)
  - Adjust seating/position to reduce pressure points
  - If available: Weighted blanket, soft blanket, or pressure stimulation (hug yourself, squeeze pillow)
- **Why**: Tactile discomfort creates constant background drain. Remove it to free up regulation capacity.
- **Tool**: Emergency comfort kit (see Tools section)

### Step 7: Breathing Reset (90 seconds)
- **Action**: Execute box breathing:
  1. Inhale for 4 counts
  2. Hold for 4 counts
  3. Exhale for 4 counts
  4. Hold for 4 counts
  5. Repeat 5 times (total 90 seconds)
- **Why**: Overload triggers fight-or-flight. Box breathing activates parasympathetic nervous system (rest mode).
- **Tool**: Phone timer (optional, or count mentally)

### Step 8: Sensory Audit (60 seconds)
- **Action**: Check each sense and eliminate remaining irritants:
  - **Sound**: Are headphones still on? Is there residual noise? (hum of lights, HVAC, outside traffic)
  - **Light**: Can you dim further? Close curtains? Turn off screens?
  - **Smell**: Is there a smell present? (open window if safe, leave room if needed)
  - **Touch**: Any remaining discomfort? (remove more clothing, adjust position)
  - **Temperature**: Too hot or cold? (adjust clothing, fan, heating)
- **Why**: Residual sensory input will prevent regulation. Eliminate everything possible.

**Total Phase 2 Time: 4-5 minutes**

---

## PHASE 3: REGULATION & RECOVERY (10-30 Minutes)

**Purpose**: Allow nervous system to downregulate from emergency state. Do not rush this phase.

### Step 9: Retreat Location Setup (If At Home)
- **Designated Location**: Identify your primary retreat location in advance:
  - **Requirements**:
    - Door you can close
    - Minimal sensory input (quiet, dim, few objects)
    - Comfortable place to sit/lie (bed, floor, couch)
    - Access to regulation tools (see Tools section)
  - **Locations by priority**:
    1. Bedroom (ideal - private, controllable)
    2. Bathroom (private, door locks, often quiet)
    3. Closet (small, dark, enclosed)
    4. Car in garage/driveway (mobile retreat)
- **Setup**: Keep regulation tools pre-positioned in retreat location
- **Family Communication**: Inform family that this is your "Do Not Disturb" space during emergencies

### Step 10: Passive Regulation Activities (10-30 minutes)
- **Action**: Engage in ONE low-input activity until you feel more regulated:
  - **Lying in darkness** (most effective for severe overload)
  - **Weighted blanket pressure** (deep pressure stimulation)
  - **Gentle rocking or swaying** (vestibular regulation)
  - **Listening to familiar music** (low volume, through headphones)
  - **Watching ceiling fan or slow-moving visual** (non-demanding visual input)
  - **Holding/petting soft object** (plush toy, soft blanket)
  - **Cold water on face/wrists** (activates parasympathetic response)
- **Do NOT**: 
  - Scroll social media (high cognitive load)
  - Problem-solve or plan (requires executive function)
  - Engage in conversation (high social load)
  - Watch TV/videos with fast cuts or dialogue (high sensory input)
- **Why**: Your nervous system needs time to reset. Passive = no demands.
- **Duration**: Minimum 10 minutes. Stay as long as needed. Do not rush.

### Step 11: Regulation Check (2 minutes)
- **Action**: Every 10 minutes, assess your state:
  1. "Is my heart rate slower?"
  2. "Can I think more clearly?"
  3. "Do I feel less desperate/trapped?"
  4. "Can I tolerate normal sensory input again?"
- **If YES to 3+**: Proceed to Step 12
- **If NO**: Continue regulation activities for another 10 minutes, then reassess

### Step 12: Gentle Re-Entry (2-5 minutes)
- **Action**: When ready to leave retreat location:
  1. Sit up slowly (if lying down)
  2. Turn on dim light gradually
  3. Remove headphones or reduce noise-canceling
  4. Stand up slowly
  5. Drink water
  6. Exit retreat location
- **Why**: Abrupt re-entry can trigger another overload. Transition gently.

**Total Phase 3 Time: 10-30 minutes (or longer if needed)**

---

## PHASE 4: POST-OVERLOAD MANAGEMENT (Rest of Day)

**Purpose**: Prevent secondary overload and protect your reduced capacity.

### Step 13: Reduced Capacity Protocol (Immediate)
- **Action**: Accept that your capacity is reduced for the rest of the day:
  - Cancel non-essential tasks
  - Reduce expectations (work at 50% capacity)
  - Avoid high-demand activities (social events, complex work, long meetings)
  - Increase rest periods between tasks
- **Why**: Overload depletes your nervous system's regulation capacity. You cannot perform normally immediately after.
- **Communication**: If needed, inform others: "I had a sensory overload episode. I need low-demand activities for the rest of today."

### Step 14: Sensory-Friendly Environment Maintenance (Ongoing)
- **Action**: For remainder of day, maintain low-sensory environment:
  - Keep Bubble Shield deployed (headphones on)
  - Reduce lighting (lamps instead of overhead)
  - Minimize screens (or use dark mode, reduce brightness)
  - Avoid triggering locations (busy stores, loud spaces, crowds)
  - Eat simple, familiar foods (avoid new textures/flavors)
- **Why**: Your sensory threshold is lowered. Normal input can trigger secondary overload.

### Step 15: Root Cause Analysis (Evening)
- **Action**: During Daily Dump (10:25 PM), reflect on today's overload:
  1. What triggered it? (environment, activity, accumulation over time)
  2. What were the early warning signs? (Level 1 signals I ignored)
  3. Could it have been prevented? (schedule change, sensory prep, earlier retreat)
  4. What worked well in my response?
  5. What do I need to adjust?
- **Tool**: Google Keep or journal
- **Why**: Overload has patterns. Document them to prevent future episodes.

## MODE-SPECIFIC SENSORY MANAGEMENT

### Solo Execution Mode
- **Higher Overload Risk**: Extended focus creates sensory tunnel-vision. You may miss early warning signs.
- **Prevention**:
  - Deploy Bubble Shield Profile 1.0 preventatively during core work blocks
  - Set hourly "sensory check" alarms (quick audit of comfort)
  - Take 5-minute sensory breaks every 90 minutes (walk outside, stretch, silence)
- **If Overload Occurs**: Full retreat. Work can wait. Your nervous system cannot.

### Family Structure Mode
- **Higher Overload Risk**: Constant social demands, noise, touch, and unpredictability create accumulating sensory load.
- **Prevention**:
  - Enforce Quiet Time Protocol (1-3 PM daily) as mandatory sensory recovery window
  - Use Bubble Shield Profile 2.0 during high-chaos times (meals, transitions, homework)
  - Communicate sensory limits to family in advance ("I need quiet time after dinner")
- **If Overload Occurs**: Retreat protocol is harder with kids. Use modified approach:
  - If children are old enough: "Mommy/Daddy needs quiet time. 15 minutes in my room. Emergency only."
  - If children are young: Tag-team with spouse or use safe enclosed space (playpen, high chair with snack) for short retreat
  - If solo parenting: Retreat to bathroom, use screen time for kids (TV is acceptable in emergencies)

## ADVANCED: SENSORY BUDGET SYSTEM

**Purpose**: Track and manage your daily sensory capacity to prevent overload before it occurs.

### Sensory Budget Concept
- You have a finite "sensory budget" each day (imagine it as 100 points)
- Each sensory input costs points:
  - Loud environment: -10/hour
  - Bright lights: -5/hour
  - Social interaction: -15/hour
  - Screen time: -5/hour
  - Physical touch: -5/occurrence
  - New environments: -20/occurrence
- Sleep, quiet time, and regulation activities restore points
- When you hit 0 points: Overload occurs

### Implementation
- **Morning Assessment**: "How much sensory capacity do I have today?" (scale 1-10)
  - Poor sleep, sick, stressed: Start at 50 points
  - Normal day: Start at 100 points
  - Well-rested, calm: Start at 120 points
- **Activity Planning**: Before committing to activity, ask: "Can I afford this?"
  - Example: "Meeting is -15 points. I have 60 points left. Yes, I can do this."
  - Example: "Party is -50 points. I have 40 points left. No, I need to decline."
- **Real-Time Tracking**: Check sensory budget every 2-3 hours:
  - "How am I feeling? Am I at 75%, 50%, 25%?"
  - At 50%: Deploy preventative measures (Bubble Shield, reduce stimulation)
  - At 25%: Execute partial retreat (Step 9-10, brief recovery)
  - At 0%: Full IPI-SO protocol

## FAMILY COMMUNICATION PROTOCOL

**Purpose**: Help family understand and support your sensory needs without requiring constant explanation.

### Signal System
- **Green Light**: Normal capacity - full availability
- **Yellow Light**: Reduced capacity - low demands only, need quiet
- **Red Light**: Overload - retreat mode, emergency contact only

**Implementation Options**:
1. **Visual Signal**: Colored card/magnet on door or visible location
2. **Verbal Signal**: Code phrase ("I'm in yellow/red")
3. **Text Signal**: Group text to family ("Red light - need 30 min")

### Pre-Teaching Family
- **Explain overload**: "My brain processes sensory input differently. Sometimes it gets overwhelmed."
- **Explain signals**: "When I say 'red light' or go to my room, I need quiet. It's not about you."
- **Explain recovery**: "I need 15-30 minutes. Then I'll be able to interact again."
- **Explain prevention**: "If you see me wearing headphones, I'm managing my sensory input. It helps me stay present."

## TOOLS REQUIRED (Prepare in Advance)

### Emergency Kit (Keep at Command Center)
- Soundcore Space One headphones (charged)
- Sunglasses
- Hoodie or soft zip-up jacket
- Earplugs (backup if headphones fail)
- Small handheld fan (temperature/white noise)
- Ice pack or cold compress
- Fidget tool or soft object
- Water bottle

### Retreat Location Setup (Keep at Retreat Location)
- Weighted blanket (15-20 lbs)
- Soft blankets/pillows
- Eye mask
- Dim lamp or nightlight
- White noise machine (optional)
- Comfort items (plush toy, soft clothing)

## SUCCESS METRICS

**You have successfully executed this protocol when:**
- You recognized early warning signs and retreated before full meltdown
- You created a low-sensory environment and allowed time to regulate
- You returned to baseline functioning (even if reduced capacity)
- You avoided secondary overload for the rest of the day

**This protocol is NOT designed to:**
- Make you immune to sensory overload (impossible)
- Eliminate all triggers (unrealistic)
- Make you function at 100% immediately after overload

**This is emergency damage control. Overload is a nervous system crisis. Treat it as such.**

---

## FINAL NOTE

**Sensory overload is not "being dramatic" or "too sensitive." It is a physiological nervous system response.** The neurodivergent nervous system processes sensory input differently—more intensely, with less filtering, and with slower recovery time.

**You are not broken. Your environment is mismatched to your nervous system.**

**This protocol is your emergency exit. Use it without guilt, without shame, without apology.**

**Key principle**: Retreat early. Recover fully. Prevent recurrence.

**Now execute it.**
