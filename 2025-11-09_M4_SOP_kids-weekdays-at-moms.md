- **Do your best** - That's all Dad asks

### If You Forget Homework at School
It's okay. It happens. Tell your teacher in the morning. Don't lie about it.

## 😰 WHEN YOU FEEL SAD, MAD, OR SCARED

### Big Feelings Are Normal
At Mom's house, you might feel:

- **Mad** - You don't want to be at two houses
- **Bored** - You don't have your LEGOs or your room at Dad's
- **Lonely** - You wish someone would play with you
- **Worried** - About school, friends, Mom and Dad, lots of things

**ALL OF THESE ARE OKAY. You're not bad for feeling this way.**

### What You Can Do Right Now (By Yourself)

#### 1. Breathing Exercise
- Breathe in slowly (count to 4)
- Hold it (count to 4)
- Breathe out slowly (count to 4)
- Do this 3 times
- You might feel a little calmer

#### 2. Tell Your Stuffed Animal
- Find any stuffed animal or toy
- Tell it how you feel
- It's okay if you cry
- The toy won't judge you

#### 3. Draw Your Feelings
- Get paper and crayons/pencil
- Draw how you feel (doesn't have to look like anything)
- Mad might be scribbles, sad might be rain
- You can rip it up after if you want

#### 4. Count Things
- Count backward from 100 (or as high as you can)
- Count all the things you can see that are blue
- Count your breaths
- This gives your brain something else to do

#### 5. Move Your Body
- Do 10 jumping jacks
- Run in place for 30 seconds
- Dance to a song in your head
- Shake your arms and legs
- Movement helps big feelings

### What to Say to Mom

- "I feel sad"
- "I miss Dad"
- "I need a hug"
- "Can I call Dad?"
- "I don't want to talk about it, but I'm upset"

**Mom loves you too. She wants to help even if she doesn't know how.**

- Tell Dad about it Friday (maybe he can help pack snacks for you)

### If You're Still Hungry
- Ask Mom: "May I have a snack?"
- Suggestions: Apple, crackers, cheese, anything simple

### Foods That Are Usually at Every House
- Bread (make toast)
- Cereal
- Fruit (usually apples or bananas)
- Crackers
- Peanut butter (if you're not allergic)

**If there's really no food, tell Dad. Dad can help.**

## 💙 DAD'S SPECIAL MESSAGE TO YOU

Dear [Daughter] and [Son],

I know this week is hard. I know you miss me. I miss you too - SO MUCH.

Every day while you're at Mom's, I think about you. I wonder how school went. I wonder if you're happy or sad. I wonder if you're sleeping okay. I wonder what you're doing right now.

I wish I could be there for dinner. I wish I could help with homework. I wish I could read you a bedtime story. I wish I could hug you whenever you need it.

But I can't be there Monday through Friday. And that's really hard. For you AND for me.

So I made this guide to be like a little piece of me you can carry around. When you read it, remember:

**I am still your dad. Every single day. Even when I'm not there.**

When you do your homework, I'm proud of you.  
When you're kind to someone, I'm proud of you.  
When you cry because you miss me, I'm proud of you for having feelings.  
When you make mistakes, I'm proud of you for being human.  
When you get through the day, I'm proud of you for being strong.

You don't have to be perfect. You don't have to be happy all the time. You just have to make it to Friday, and I'll be there.

**I promise I will always come get you on Friday. Always.**

I love you bigger than the whole sky.

**Love,  
Dad** 💙
