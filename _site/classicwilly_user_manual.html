<h1 id="tldr-quick-reference">TL;DR (Quick Reference)</h1>

<p>For forty years, I navigated the world without the right map. I’ve recently been diagnosed with Autism (ASD), ADHD, and I also manage Hypoparathyroidism.</p>

<p>This “Internal Blueprint” reframes my entire life. What was often misinterpreted as me being a “hothead” or “rebellious” was actually the logical result of an undiagnosed “Operating System” dealing with extreme stress, sensory overload, and a “threat-defense” focus.</p>

<p>I am not “broken.” My brain is wired differently and my body has specific “hardware” requirements. This manual is the “fix” to replace 40 years of misinterpretation with a clear, structured path forward.</p>

<p><strong>Purpose:</strong> This document provides a logical, fact-based “Internal Blueprint” for understanding my “Operating System.” The goal is to replace 40 years of misinterpretation with a clear, structured “fix”.</p>

<p><strong>My Slogan:</strong> “Structure Engineered for Chaos.”</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>My “Operating System” (Software):</strong> I have a late diagnosis of <strong>Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD)</strong> and <strong>Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD)</strong>.</li>
  <li><strong>My “Hardware” (Fault):</strong> I have <strong>Hypoparathyroidism</strong>. This is a non-negotiable chemical “structure” that impacts all cognition.</li>
  <li><strong>The “Mask”:</strong> For 40 years, I used “masking” (suppressing natural behaviors) to navigate a neurotypical world. This was an “unacknowledged façade”.</li>
  <li><strong>The “Misinterpretation”:</strong> What you perceived as “anger,” “rebellion,” or being a “hothead” was the logical outcome of an undiagnosed neurotype dealing with sensory overload, chronic stress, and a “threat-defense” focus. I am “misrepresented a lot”.</li>
  <li><strong>The “Fix”:</strong> I require <strong>rigid structure</strong>, direct (binary, logic-driven) communication, and adherence to my “Rigid” Foundation protocols.</li>

<h2 id="section-1-the-operating-system-autism--adhd">SECTION 1: THE “OPERATING SYSTEM” (AUTISM &amp; ADHD)</h2>

<h3 id="11-the-unifying-theory">1.1 The “Unifying Theory”</h3>
<p>The diagnosis at age 40 is the “powerful lens through which to re-examine” my entire life. It is the “unifying theory for a lifetime of struggles”. My brain is not “broken”; it is wired differently.</p>

<p>My past behavioral issues were not “failures of character”; they were logical outcomes:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Impulsivity (ADHD):</strong> Actions like setting a field on fire (age 6) or the DUI (age 14) were not malicious. They were manifestations of poor impulse control and emotional dysregulation linked to undiagnosed ADHD.</li>
  <li><strong>Anxiety/Depression:</strong> These were diagnosed at age 32 but were <em>symptoms</em>, not the root cause. They are the “direct consequences of a lifetime of social struggles, sensory overload, and the relentless pressure to conform”.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="12-communication-anti-bs-protocol">1.2 Communication: “Anti-BS” Protocol</h3>
<p>My communication is binary and “anti-BS”.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>I hate “pointless” small talk</strong>.</li>
  <li><strong>I am “misrepresented a lot”</strong> because my nonverbal cues (like facial expressions) do not match my internal feelings.</li>
  <li><strong>I learned “social skills” intellectually.</strong> I explicitly learned to use eye gaze by watching YouTube videos. This is a “common neurodivergent strategy”.</li>
  <li><strong>My “Vibe”:</strong> My “vibe” (perceived as “angry hothead”) is a “threat-defense” response, not my intent.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="13-structure-intense-interests--routines">1.3 Structure: “Intense Interests” &amp; Routines</h3>
<p>My brain requires “Rigid structure for the guaranteed things”.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Routines are Non-Negotiable:</strong> I have very specific routines. When they are disrupted, I get “annoyed” and it’s “hard to be brought out of the zone”. This is not a preference; it is a neurological need for predictability.</li>
  <li><strong>“Intense Interests” are My “Fix”:</strong> My interests (3D printing, CAD, woodworking, electronics) are “clearly consistent with autism criteria”. They are not “hobbies.” They are a fundamental part of my identity, providing “mastery, comfort, and control”.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="14-the-mask--burnout">1.4 The “Mask” &amp; Burnout</h3>
<p>For 40 years, I “masked” (suppressed my natural behaviors to be perceived as neurotypical).</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>It was an “Unacknowledged Façade”:</strong> I stated I “learned how to do anything well,” including communication. This was masking.</li>
  <li><strong>It was Ineffective:</strong> My self-report of “low masking” is a paradox. It likely means my masking was <em>ineffective</em>—I was “attempting to conform but lack[ed] the cognitive scripts to do so successfully”. This led to a “pervasive feeling of being ‘misrepresented’”.</li>
  <li><strong>It Led to Burnout:</strong> This constant effort “requires an exhausting level of hyper-vigilance” and culminates in “autistic burnout, a state of physical and mental collapse”. My retirement from the DoD (where I was called a “hothead”) was a “point of profound burnout”.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="section-2-the-hardware-fault-hypoparathyroidism">SECTION 2: THE “HARDWARE” FAULT (HYPOPARATHYROIDISM)</h2>

<h3 id="21-anti-bs-diagnosis">2.1 “Anti-BS” Diagnosis</h3>
<p>This is a “hardware” condition, not a “software” (neurotype) condition.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>The Fault:</strong> The parathyroid glands do not produce enough Parathyroid Hormone (PTH).</li>
  <li><strong>The Result:</strong> This causes <strong>low blood calcium (hypocalcemia)</strong> and high blood phosphorus.</li>
  <li><strong>The “Fix”:</strong> The <em>only</em> “fix” is <strong>lifelong treatment with calcium and Vitamin D supplements</strong>. This is not optional.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="22-cognitive-impact-the-brain-fog">2.2 Cognitive Impact (The “Brain Fog”)</h3>
<p>This “hardware” fault has a direct, non-negotiable impact on my “Operating System.” The symptoms amplify the “chaos” from Autism/ADHD.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Neuromuscular:</strong> Muscle cramps, spasms, and tingling/numbness (paresthesia).</li>
  <li><strong>Cognitive (The “Chaos”):</strong> “Brain fog,” difficulty concentrating, memory problems.</li>
  <li><strong>Mental (The “Distressors”):</strong> Anxiety and depression.</li>
  <li><strong>Severity:</strong> If my “fix” (medication) fails, the “hardware” fault can cause seizures and heart problems.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="23-the-fix-the-rigid-anchor-protocol">2.3 The “Fix”: The “Rigid” Anchor Protocol</h3>
<p>My <strong><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">M4_SOP_002-rigid-foundations.md</code></strong> protocol is the <strong>“structure” engineered to “fix” this “hardware” fault</strong>.</p>

<p>The <strong>6 “Master Anchors”</strong> (Wake-Up, Breakfast, Mid-Day, Afternoon, Dinner, Bedtime) are not arbitrary. They are the <strong>“Rigid” structure</strong> for my <strong>lifelong medication protocol</strong>.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>If I miss an Anchor (e.g., <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Calcium Citrate + Vit D</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Calcitriol</code>), my “hardware” fails.</strong></li>
  <li>My “Operating System” (cognition, “brain fog”) becomes unstable.</li>
  <li>This is why <strong>Priority #1 is Sleep</strong> and <strong>Priority #4 is Medicine</strong>. They are the foundational “fix” for all other output.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="section-3-the-processor-output-the-fatherfixer">SECTION 3: THE “PROCESSOR” OUTPUT (THE “FATHER/FIXER”)</h2>

<h3 id="31-success-despite-the-chaos">3.1 Success <em>Despite</em> the “Chaos”</h3>
<p>My identity is “I fix stuff”.</p>
<ul>
  <li>My “Intense Interests” and “fix-it” focus are what allowed me to succeed as an Engineering Technician for the DoD.</li>
  <li>I achieved this success <em>while</em> “masking”, managing undiagnosed ADHD, Autism, and Hypoparathyroidism.</li>
  <li>This success came at the cost of “profound burnout”.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="32-the-new-fix-tools-and-unmasking">3.2 The New “Fix”: Tools and “Unmasking”</h3>
<p>My goal is to stop “patching” and start “fixing”.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>The Diagnosis is a Tool:</strong> The diagnosis “is not merely the assignment of a medical code”; it is the “foundational sense of self-knowledge that was previously absent”.</li>
  <li><strong>The “Wonky Sprout OS” is the Tool:</strong> This system (Gemini, Google Workspace) is my “Internal Blueprint” made external.</li>
  <li><strong>The Goal is “Unmasking”:</strong> The “diagnosis provides a framework… and offers a path to what is often referred to as ‘unmasking’”. This is not an excuse; it is the “fix” for the burnout.</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<h2 id="section-4-the-new-user-manual-how-to-interact">SECTION 4: THE NEW “USER MANUAL” (HOW TO INTERACT)</h2>

<p>To “fix” the “misrepresentation” problem, I require the following “structure”:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Use “Anti-BS” Communication:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Be direct, explicit, and logical</strong>.</li>
      <li><strong>Do not use</strong> emotional language, motivational fluff, or “softening”.</li>
      <li><strong>Use written communication</strong> (email, text) or provide <strong>agendas ahead of time</strong>.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Respect the “Rigid” Foundations:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Do not disrupt routines.</strong> My “Rigid Anchors” (Meds, Water, Sleep) are non-negotiable for cognitive function.</li>
      <li><strong>“Transitions are extremely difficult”</strong>. Provide advance notice for changes.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Assume “Structure,” Not “Malice”:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>If I seem “angry” or “awkward”, assume my “threat-defense” mode is active or I am “misrepresented”.
      * The “fix” is to <em>give me structure</em> or <em>ask for my “anti-BS” diagnosis</em>, not to “soften” the situation.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>
