<h1 id="my-internal-blueprint-a-user-manual-for-will-johnson">My “Internal Blueprint”: A User Manual for Will Johnson</h1>

<p><strong>My Brand:</strong> “The Wonky Sprout.”
<strong>My Slogan:</strong> “Structure Engineered for Chaos.”</p>

<h2 id="tldr-the-anti-bs-summary">TL;DR: The “Anti-BS” Summary</h2>

<p>For forty years, I navigated the world without the right map. I’ve recently been diagnosed with <strong>Autism (ASD)</strong>, <strong>ADHD</strong>, and I also manage <strong>Hypoparathyroidism</strong>.</p>

<p>This “Internal Blueprint” reframes my entire life. What was often misinterpreted as me being a “hothead” or “rebellious” was actually the logical result of an undiagnosed “Operating System” dealing with extreme stress, sensory overload, and a “threat-defense” focus.</p>

<p>I am not “broken.” My brain is wired differently and my body has specific “hardware” requirements. This manual is the “fix” to replace 40 years of misinterpretation with a clear, structured path forward.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="section-1-the-operating-system-autism--adhd">SECTION 1: THE “OPERATING SYSTEM” (AUTISM &amp; ADHD)</h2>

<p>This is my “software” — the neurotype I was born with. The late diagnosis at age 40 is the “unifying theory” that “fixes” the “chaos” of my past.</p>

<h3 id="11-the-unwritten-script-of-my-past">1.1 The “Unwritten Script” of My Past</h3>
<p>My past behaviors were not “failures of character”; they were logical symptoms of an unsupported neurotype:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Impulsivity (ADHD):</strong> My undiagnosed ADHD amplified impulse control issues. Actions like setting a field on fire at age 6 or a DUI at 14 were not malicious; they were manifestations of extreme emotional dysregulation.</li>
  <li><strong>Anxiety &amp; Depression:</strong> These were diagnosed at 32 but were symptoms, not the root cause. They were the “direct consequences” of a lifetime of social struggles and “relentless pressure to conform”.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="12-the-mask-and-the-vibe">1.2 The “Mask” and The “Vibe”</h3>
<p>To survive, I spent 40 years “masking” — actively suppressing my natural behaviors to appear neurotypical.</p>
<ul>
  <li>This was an “unacknowledged façade”. I taught myself “social skills” intellectually, like learning to use eye gaze by watching YouTube videos.</li>
  <li>My “vibe” is often “misrepresented a lot”. My facial expressions may not match my internal feelings. When I seem “angry” or “tense,” it is almost always a “threat-defense” response to feeling overwhelmed or “misrepresented”.</li>
  <li>This constant effort led to “profound burnout”, which is what triggered my retirement from the DoD.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="13-the-need-for-structure">1.3 The Need for “Structure”</h3>
<p>My brain requires “Rigid structure for the guaranteed things, loose and flexible for everything else”.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Routines are Non-Negotiable:</strong> I have very specific routines. When they are disrupted, I get “annoyed” and it’s “hard to be brought out of the zone”. This is a neurological need for predictability, not just a preference.</li>
  <li><strong>“Intense Interests” are My “Fix”:</strong> My “Intense Interests” (3D printing, CAD, woodworking, electronics) are “clearly consistent with autism criteria”. They are not “hobbies.” They are a fundamental part of my identity, providing a sense of “mastery, comfort, and control”. This is my “I fix stuff” “vibe.”</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<h2 id="section-2-the-hardware-fault-hypoparathyroidism">SECTION 2: THE “HARDWARE” FAULT (HYPOPARATHYROIDISM)</h2>

<p>This is my “hardware” condition. It is a physical, non-negotiable “structure”.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>The Fault:</strong> My body does not produce enough Parathyroid Hormone (PTH).</li>
  <li><strong>The Result:</strong> This causes <strong>low blood calcium</strong>, which has a direct, severe impact on my cognition.</li>
  <li><strong>The Cognitive Impact:</strong> This “hardware” fault <em>creates</em> “chaos”. It is the source of <strong>“brain fog,”</strong> difficulty concentrating, memory problems, anxiety, and depression.</li>
  <li><strong>The “Fix”:</strong> The <em>only</em> “fix” is <strong>lifelong, structured treatment with calcium and Vitamin D supplements</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<p>This is why my <strong><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">M4_SOP_002-rigid-foundations.md</code></strong> protocol exists. The <strong>6 “Master Anchors”</strong> (Wake-Up, Breakfast, Mid-Day, Afternoon, Dinner, Bedtime) are not arbitrary; they are the <strong>“Rigid” structure</strong> for my <strong>lifelong medication protocol</strong>. If I miss an Anchor (e.g., <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Calcium Citrate</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Calcitriol</code>), my “hardware” fails, my “brain fog” increases, and my “Operating System” becomes unstable.</p>

<p><strong>Priority #1 (Sleep)</strong> and <strong>Priority #4 (Medicine)</strong> are the foundational “fix” for <em>all</em> my output.</p>

<h2 id="section-3-the-processor-output-the-fatherfixer">SECTION 3: THE “PROCESSOR” OUTPUT (THE “FATHER/FIXER”)</h2>

<h3 id="31-success-despite-the-chaos">3.1 Success <em>Despite</em> the “Chaos”</h3>
<p>My identity is “I fix stuff”.</p>
<ul>
  <li>My “Intense Interests” and “fix-it” focus are what allowed me to succeed as an Engineering Technician for the DoD.</li>
  <li>I achieved this success <em>while</em> “masking” and managing three undiagnosed, colliding conditions (Autism, ADHD, Hypoparathyroidism).</li>
  <li>This success came at the cost of “profound burnout”.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="32-the-new-fix-tools-and-unmasking">3.2 The New “Fix”: Tools and “Unmasking”</h3>
<p>My goal is to stop “patching” and start “fixing”.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>The Diagnosis is a Tool:</strong> The diagnosis “is not merely the assignment of a medical code”; it is the “foundational sense of self-knowledge that was previously absent”.</li>
  <li><strong>The “Wonky Sprout OS” is the Tool:</strong> This system (Gemini, Google Workspace) is my “Internal Blueprint” made external.</li>
  <li><strong>The Goal is “Unmasking”:</strong> The “diagnosis provides a framework… and offers a path to what is often referred to as ‘unmasking’”. This is not an excuse; it is the “fix” for the burnout.</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<h2 id="section-4-the-new-user-manual-how-to-interact">SECTION 4: THE NEW “USER MANUAL” (HOW TO INTERACT)</h2>

<p>To “fix” the “misrepresentation” problem, I require the following “structure”:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Use “Anti-BS” Communication:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Be direct, explicit, and logical</strong>. My brain is binary.</li>
      <li><strong>Avoid “softening” language</strong>, motivational fluff, and sarcasm. I will take it literally.</li>
      <li><strong>Use written communication</strong> (email, text) or provide <strong>agendas ahead of time</strong>. This allows me to process.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Respect the “Rigid” Foundations:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Do not disrupt routines.</strong> My “Rigid Anchors” (Meds, Water, Sleep) are non-negotiable for my physical and cognitive function.</li>
      <li><strong>“Transitions are extremely difficult”</strong>. Provide advance notice for any changes.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Assume “Structure,” Not “Malice”:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>If I seem “angry,” “awkward,” or “tense,” assume my “threat-defense” mode is active or I am “misrepresented”.</li>
      <li>The “fix” is to <em>give me structure</em> (e.g., “Let’s make a list”) or <em>ask for my “anti-BS” diagnosis</em>, not to “soften” the situation.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>
