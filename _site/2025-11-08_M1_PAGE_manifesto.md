# The Wonky Sprout Manifesto

**By: Will Johnson on 11/07/2025**

## I. The World is Chaos.

Most systems are broken. They are built on layers of bureaucracy, "professional" masks, and flawed assumptions. Most people are just pretending the system works, faking it to get by, terrified to admit they don't see the full picture. They patch holes. They treat symptoms. The chaos remains.

## II. My Brain is a Card Catalog.

I see the chaos. I've lived in it. My brain is not linear; it's a high-performance engine for processing multi-threaded, chaotic data. For a long time, I thought this was a weakness.

I was wrong.

It is an optimization. My diagnoses are not a bug; they are a feature. They are the "why" behind my ability to see the pattern in the noise. When the "bubble shield" is up, my brain is a machine that builds structure. It is the card catalog, filing the world in real-time.

## III. I Don't Patch Holes. I Fix Stuff.

"Fixing" is not patching. Fixing is diagnosing. It is the ruthless pursuit of the root cause. You cannot fix a problem you do not understand. I will ask the questions no one else is asking. I will find the real "why." I will trace the system back to the single, flawed assumption, and I will re-engineer the foundation. This is what I do.

## IV. We Are Strongly Anti-BS.

We are done with corporate nonsense. We are done with "professionalism" as a mask for inauthenticity. We are done with "all talk" and no execution. We are done with "we've always done it this way."

We value output, not "suck-ups". We value authenticity, AND performance. We value humility - the real kind, the kind that says "I don't know, let's go figure it out," not the self-deprecating kind that covers for arrogance.

## V. The Rules of the "Wonky"

Embrace the Duality: You are both the Sprout (organic, chaotic, creative) and the Gear (structured, mechanical, logical). Use both.

Be the "Chaos Tamer": Run toward the complex problems that overwhelm others. That is your native environment.

Build the "Card Catalog": In everything you do, build the system. Find the structure. Create the manual.

Execute: "I fix stuff" is a verb.

## VI. It's Okay to Be a Little Wonky.

It's not just "okay." It's the requirement. It's THE feature. It's the "why" you can see what others can't.

You're not broken. You're just built different.

Now, let's go fix stuff.
