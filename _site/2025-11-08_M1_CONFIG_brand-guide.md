# The Wonky Sprout - Brand Guide v2.0

**Updated November 9, 2025 by William Johnson**

---

## Brand Name

**The Wonky Sprout**

---

## Core Identity

**The personal brand of William Johnson.** A system built to transform neurodivergent chaos into manageable, high-output structure.

This is not a corporate operation or a motivational brand. This is an **engineering solution** for neurodivergent life management.

---

## The Brand Slogan (The "Fix")

**"The Wonky Sprout: Structure Engineered for Chaos."**

This is an 11/10 choice because it perfectly fuses the engineering background (Navy Systems Diagnostician) with the personal brand identity (neurodivergent father building life protocols).

---

## The "Why" (The Origin Story)

I was diagnosed with **Autism and ADHD at 40**. For my entire life, I've experienced the world through a lens of chaos—a brain I described as "a little man in my head bombarded with every possible thought."

During meditation, I had a profound experience where I watched my brain **file itself in real-time**, like a card catalog. This brand is the synthesis of that moment: **chaos organized into structure**.

As a **Navy Systems Diagnostician** for 15 years, my job was to find root causes, not patch holes. When I turned that diagnostic lens on my own life, the pattern became clear: **my brain is not broken—it's a high-performance engine that needs proper structure to absorb external chaos.**

---

## The Core Message (The "Wonky" Principle)

**"Structure and organization with a bit of chaos."**

This brand is the perfect blend of two opposing, but complementary, forces:

* **The Sprout (Organic Chaos)**: Represents natural, non-linear, neurodivergent thinking. Growth, adaptation, life force. The "wonky" part.
* **The Mechanical (Structured Order)**: Represents the "card catalog"—the gears, circuits, hexagons, and engineered systems that absorb chaos. The "fix stuff" part.

**The fusion:** Chaos is the input. Structure is the solution. The brand IS the engineering process.

---

## The Vibe (How It Feels)

* **"Manly, still soft."** - Strong systems, gentle execution
* **"I fix stuff."** - Direct, action-oriented, no-BS engineering mindset
* **Authentic, direct, and systems-oriented** - Not inspiration, not philosophy, **solution**

## Key Visuals

### The Emblem
A **sprout** (organic growth, neurodivergent nature) growing from a base of **circuit-board-like hexagons** (engineered structure, systems thinking).

**Symbolism:**
- **Sprout**: Natural, adaptive, growing life force
- **Circuit hexagons**: Precision, logic, engineered foundation  
- **Fusion**: Chaos absorbed by structure, organic meets systematic

### The Logotype
The name **"The Wonky Sprout"** where the **"O"s are intricate, colorful gears** (the engineered fix).

**Typography:**
- **Primary Font**: Space Grotesk (clean, modern, humanist sans-serif)
- **Accent Font**: IBM Plex Mono (monospaced, engineering mindset)

### The Palette
A mix of **natural greens** (sprout, growth) with **industrial teals/blues** (circuitry, precision) and **vibrant accents** (orange, purple, yellow) for energy and engagement.

**See full color palette in the complete brand guide for hex codes and usage guidelines.**

## The Engineering Metaphor (Core Framework)

| Element | Personal Brand | Engineering Parallel |
|---------|---------------|---------------------|
| **Input** | Life chaos (sensory, executive, emotional) | External load on system |
| **Processor** | ADHD/Autism brain (hyper-focus, pattern recognition) | High-performance diagnostic engine |
| **Output** | SOPs, digital systems, protocols | Engineered solutions |
| **Result** | Functional life structure | System that absorbs chaos without failing |

---

## Voice & Tone (The "Anti-BS" Framework)

### What We DO:
- ✅ Number steps (1, 2, 3)
- ✅ Use direct language ("This fixes X")
- ✅ Acknowledge executive dysfunction
- ✅ Provide exact time/energy requirements
- ✅ Build systems that work when your brain doesn't
- ✅ Write for neurodivergent readers first

### What We DON'T:
- ❌ Use corporate jargon or buzzwords
- ❌ Write motivational fluff ("You got this!")
- ❌ Hide complexity with vague promises
- ❌ Assume neurotypical workflow patterns
- ❌ Create "inspiration" without action
- ❌ Pretend systems don't require maintenance

## Positioning Statement

> "The Wonky Sprout is an engineering solution for neurodivergent life management. Built by a Navy Systems Diagnostician who spent 15 years finding root causes, not patching holes. I fix stuff."

---

## The Non-Negotiables

1. **Dark mode first** - Light mode causes sensory pain for many neurodivergent users
2. **No fake motivation** - Systems over inspiration
3. **Exact instructions** - Number steps, specify times
4. **Acknowledge dysfunction** - Don't pretend executive function is optional
5. **Structure absorbs chaos** - The brand IS the engineering solution

---

## The Slogan Breakdown

**"The Wonky Sprout: Structure Engineered for Chaos."**

- **The Wonky Sprout** = Brand name (organic + systematic fusion)
- **Structure** = The output (SOPs, protocols, systems)
- **Engineered** = The method (diagnostic, root-cause, precision)
- **For Chaos** = The input (neurodivergent life, co-parenting, sensory overload)

**This is not a philosophy. This is an engineering solution.**
