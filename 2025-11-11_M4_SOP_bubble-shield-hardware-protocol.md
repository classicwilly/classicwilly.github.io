# MLP-007: Bubble Shield Hardware Protocol (Mandatory Sensory Fix)

**PURPOSE:** To define and mandate the use of sensory mitigation tools as non-negotiable assistive technology. This hardware is required to maintain stable executive function and prevent sensory overload/burnout. Treating these items as "wants" is a non-conforming condition.

## 1.0 AUDITORY FIX (THE "SOUND FILTER")
**Non-Conforming Condition:** Unpredictable, unpleasant noise (airplanes, voices, police sirens).
**Mandatory Hardware:** Noise-Cancelling Headphones (Soundcore Space One or equivalent).
**Protocol:** Headphones are required during all dedicated work/focus periods and system transitions.
**Function:** Use Profile 1.0 (Transparency 3) for deep focus or Profile 2.0 (Transparency 5) for high-vigilance/family mode (refer to `2025-11-08_M4_CONFIG_gemini-master-bootstrap-v2.md` for profile details).

## 2.0 VISUAL FIX (THE "LIGHT FILTER")
**Non-Conforming Condition:** Overstimulation from harsh, bright, or flickering light sources (fluorescents, sunlight, screen glare).
**Mandatory Hardware:** Sunglasses (or Blue-Light Filtering Glasses).
**Protocol:** Sunglasses must be kept at the Command Center (desk) and used:
1. Immediately upon leaving the house.
2. When working on a computer screen for more than 2 hours (use blue-light filters).
3. When working in any environment with harsh overhead lighting.

## 3.0 TACTILE/MOTION FIX (THE "GROUNDING SYSTEM")
**Non-Conforming Condition:** Internal restlessness (ADHD/Vyvanse response) and difficulty transitioning focus.
**Mandatory Hardware (Examples):**
*   **Weighted Blanket/Vest:** For evening "Shutdown" Transition (refer to `2025-11-09_M4_SOP_002-rigid-foundations.md`) or during high-anxiety focus blocks. Provides stabilizing deep pressure input.
*   **Fidget Cube/Tool:** Must be kept on the desk during all "Work Blocks" (Priority #7). It allows restless energy to be channeled into a quiet, structured motor pattern, preventing the energy from causing cognitive disruption.
*   **Ergonomic Chair/Standing Desk:** A flexible, adjustable workstation is required to accommodate positional shifts and movement during long work sessions.

## 4.0 OTHER CRITICAL SENSORY ITEMS
The underlying cause of many daily "non-conforming conditions" is sensory input mismatch. Other items that often transition from "want" to "need" for neurodivergent individuals include:
*   **Non-Verbal Communication Aids:** A small, easy-to-read whiteboard or notebook (like Google Keep) used to communicate simple needs (e.g., "In a meeting, do not disturb," "5 minutes until dinner") to children or family members without relying on verbal, reciprocal communication, which is often difficult.
*   **Textured/Comfort Items:** Specific clothing textures, soft throws, or comfort objects used during "Shutdown" or periods of high stress.
*   **Routine Visuals:** A visible, analog clock or a prominent visual schedule (e.g., the whiteboard for the "Family Structure" mode) to ease the difficulty of transitions and reduce reliance on abstract time concepts.
